Krish just finished reading about rectangles, and he has learned how to compute the area of a rectangle. However, he doesn't know whether his answer is correct.
He needs your help! Write a class that computes the area of a rectangle.

Create two classes: "Rectangle" and "RectangleArea" with the following 
specifications:
Class1: Rectangle
Member1: width
Member2: height
Method1: Display(), to display the dimensions of rectangle.
Class2: RectangleArea, derived from class Rectangle.
Method1: Input(), to read the width and height of a rectangle.
Method2: Display(), overloaded function to display the area of rectangle.

Input Format

The first and only line of input contains two space separated integers denoting 
the width and height of the rectangle.

Constraints
1<=width<=100.1<=width<=100.
1<=height<=100.1<=height<=100.

Output Format

In the first line, print the width and height of the rectangle with a single 
space in between.
In the next line, print the area of the rectangle.

Sample Input

10 5

Sample Output

10 5
50

Explanation

Area of rectangle is calculated as: width*height = 10*5 = 50.
