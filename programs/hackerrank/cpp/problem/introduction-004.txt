if and else are two of the most heavily used conditionals in C/C++. They are 
used to execute zero or one statement among many statements.

They are be used in the following three ways.

    if: It is used to execute a statement, given the condition is true.

    if(condition) {
        ...
    }

    if - else: It is used to execute exactly one of the two statements.

    if(first condition) {
        ...
    }
    else {
        ...
    }

    if - else if - else: It is used to execute one of the multiple statements.

    if(first condition) {
        ...
    }
    else if(second condition) {
        ...
    }
    .
    .
    .
    else if((n-1)'th condition) {

    }
    else {
        ...
    }

You are given a positive integer, nn,:

    If 1≤n≤91≤n≤9, then print the English representation of it. That is "one" 
for 1, "two" for 2, and so on.
    Otherwise print "Greater than 9" (without quotes).
