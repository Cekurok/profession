- when a static member is declared inside class it has to be defined outside to
  allocate memory for the static variable. when it is not defined and when we 
  tried to access it then it throws compilation error.
- only const static member can be initialized inside a class.
- const static member initialized inside a class do not need definition.
- the order of constructor called will be in the order of their derivation if 
derived class derives base 2 and base 1, then base 2, base 1 and derived 
class constructor are called. The destructor will be called in reverse order.
