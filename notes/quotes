1. APJ Abdul Kalam
************************************************************
--> If you salute your duty, you need not salute anybody. But if you pollute your duty, you have to salute everybody.
--> My message, especially to young people, is to have courage to think differently, courage to invent, to travel the unexplored path, courage to discover the impossible and to conquer the problems and succeed. These are the qualities that they must work towards. This is my message to the young people.
--> Thinking is progress, Non-thinking is stagnation of the individual, organisation and the country. Thinking leads to action. Knowledge without action is useless and irrelevant. Knowledge with action, converts adversity into prosperity.
--> Don't take rest after your first victory, because if you fall in the second, more lips are waiting to say that your first victory was just luck.
--> When our signature changes to autograph, that marks the success.
--> We should not give up and we should not allow the problem to defeat us.
--> Difficulties in your life do not come to destroy you, but to help you realise your hidden potential and power. Let difficulties know that you too are difficult.
--> Those who cannot work with their hearts achieve but a hollow, half-hearted success that breeds bitterness all around.
--> Don't read success stories, you will only get a message. Read failure stories, you will get some ideas to get success.
--> Your best teacher is your last mistake.

2. Swami Vivekandha
************************************************************
--> Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.
--> You have to grow from the inside out. None can teach you, none can make you spiritual. There is no other teacher but your own soul.
--> You cannot believe in God until you believe in yourself.
--> We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live; they travel far.
--> Our duty is to encourage every one in his struggle to live up to his own highest idea, and strive at the same time to make the ideal as near as possible to the Truth.
--> The moment I have realized God sitting in the temple of every human body, the moment I stand in reverence before every human being and see God in him - that moment I am free from bondage, everything that binds vanishes, and I am free.
--> Where can we go to find God if we cannot see Him in our own hearts and in every living being.
--> If money help a man to do good to others, it is of some value; but if not, it is simply a mass of evil, and the sooner it is got rid of, the better.
--> When an idea exclusively occupies the mind, it is transformed into an actual physical or mental state.
--> The Vedanta recognizes no sin it only recognizes error. And the greatest error, says the Vedanta is to say that you are weak, that you are a sinner, a miserable creature, and that you have no power and you cannot do this and that.
--> Truth can be stated in a thousand different ways, yet each one can be true.
--> That man has reached immortality who is disturbed by nothing material.

3. George Carlin
************************************************************
--> Things aren't always what they seem.  
--> Governments don't want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. 
--> "Bullshit is the glue that holds this country together."
--> "To learn who rules over you, simply find out who are you not allowed to criticize." - Voltaireï»¿
