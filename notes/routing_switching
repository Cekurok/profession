Part 1 - Networking Basics
Module 1 - Networking Concepts

--> The Purpose of Networks
 - Network is all about making connection

--> Common Network Components
 - Client : How the user interfaces with the network
 - File Server : A computer that shares the hard drive with clients
 - Server, 
 - Router : router makes routing decision based on logical address
 - Switch : a layer two device  

--> legacy network components
 - hub, media access unit(MAU), bridge

--> hub
 - interconnects clients, servers and other network devices
 - does not make forwarding decisions
 - also known as "bit spitter"
 - used in ethernet networks
 - one collision domain (only one packet at the network)
 - one broadcast domain

--> MAU
 - interconnects clients, servers and other network devices
 - does not make forwarding decisions
 - used in token ring networks
 - collision domains don't apply here
 - one broadcast domain

 --> bridge
  - separates networks into collision domains
  - makes forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses
  - the predecessor to the ethernet switch
  - if bridge has two ports then it has two collision domains
  - one broadcast domain

 --> network media
  - coaxial cable, twisted pair, fiber optics

 --> coaxial cable
  - used in 10BASE2 and 10BASE5 ethernet networks
  - 50 ohms of impedence

 --> twisted pair
  - the twists in the wire protect the inner conductor from electro-magnetic
  interference (EMI)
  - shielded and unshielded options
  - most common media type found in modern LANs
  - TIA/EIA-568 standard - 1991 : defined colour coding for wiring an RJ-45 jack
  - TIA/EIA is a standard body -  Telecommunication Industry
  Association/Electronic Industries Alliance
  - TIA/EIA-568 B standard in 2001 is an updated version to 1991 standard
  - category      common use
       3       PBX and 10BASE-T
       5       100BASE-TX
       5e      1000BASE-T
       6       1000BASE-T
       6e      10GBASE-T
  - RJ-45 connects has 8 pin but ethernet uses only four pin (1,2,3 and 6)
  - crossover cables
  - media-dependent interface crossover (MDIX) - can reverse a port's transmit
  and receive pairs as needed
  
 --> fiber optics
