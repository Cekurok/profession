THE BEST AND WORST IN HISTORY -- NIKOLA TESLA AND ANTE PAVELIC -- 
CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL

YES TO NIKOLA TESLA, NO TO ANTE PAVELIC--   CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL

indigo adult , nikola tesla is the best man to walk on this planet. ante pavelic
was the most evil man in history. both were deleted from history, by vested 
interests. serbian nicola tesla is the greatest genius ever to walk on this 
planet.  he was a greater genius than von neumann or einstein. his fault was 
that he would not allow his inventions to be metered , so that the world citizen
could be bled. he would not allow his discoveries to be used against mankind. 
he was denied a nobel prize, for radio transmission and ac electricity. marconi 
and edison ran him down, after all he was just a eastern orthodox serb , 
a lesser mortal.  vested interests tried to steal his intellectual property 
again and again, so he kept his scalar wave and free energy inventions inside 
his head. now it is lost for ever. the world has been set back by 500 years. 
swami vivekananda met tesla in chicago and introduced him to the ZERO POINT 
ENERGY FIELD , of akasha ( ether ).--the all pervasive sky of quantum energy 
of the universe.  reiki practitioners know what scalar waves can do. crop 
circles were a huge mystery till one fine day a tesla coil cropped up in a 
corn field. He told Tesla that classical science must factor human consciousness
in, or be stuck in the mud for ever.I DO HOPE JULY 10TH ( TESLA'S BIRTHDAY ) IS 
CELEBRATED ALL OVER THE WORLD AS " SCIENCE FOR PEACE DAY ". i also do hope, one 
day Tesla's graphic face above , will be as popular a graphic for a human body 
tattoo-- as the face of Che Guevara.  one was full of intelligence, the other 
was full of spirit. croat ante pavelic killed more people ( orthodox serbs and 
gypsies) than hitler. even the nazis were amazed and horrified at his mad 
cruelty. he either killed or converted. killing was mostly by ritually burning 
alive in furnaces , as approved penalty for heresy. he was rewarded with 
christmas greetings and holiday stay at pope pius xii's summer residence. after 
the 2nd world war ante pavelic was disguised as a priest and hidden in a 
monastry castel gandolfo ,near rome. from there he was smuggled him to 
argentina. after ante pavelic fled to argentina , his companions left in the 
lurch, ran and surrendered to British commanders in the area. These British 
commanders wisely refused to accept their opportunistic surrender and handed 
them over to the partisans, who ruthlessly dished out the severe backlash 
massacre. BUT FOR THE  INFORMATION SUPER-HIGHWAY PROVIDED BY THE LARGE HEARTED 
INTERNET-- THE TRUTH WOULD HAVE BEEN BURIED FOR EVER!!

CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL -- PEP TALK TO HIS CADETS

SAY YES TO THE SEA!

most shore desk jobs absorb and degrade the mind - where else but at sea can you
have a 4 to 5 months sabbatical- nay - hibernation every year , to blast the 
calcium off your pineal gland and clear your "teesra aankh" .. life is either a 
daring adventure, or nothing. cruise around crystal blue waters and breathe in 
fresh ozone tinged salty air , while earning good money-- EARNING IN DOLLARS AND
SPENDING IN RUPEES-- makes sense---right? there is no need to be a hypocrite at 
sea. you build great friendships with varying cultures . the ones you don’t like
,you don’t need to see after you finish your short contract on board, so you can
be yourself. there is no need to smile at a face whose nose you feel like 
bloodying . ashore on a desk job you may have to tolerate such a face in front 
of your desk for years. to have a working relationship ashore you must fake your
feelings. you may not be a millionaire at sea-- but you will surely pay all your
elite living style bills and have the time of your life while having your own 
style. the deep blue sea delights the human senses, one of the reasons why 
sailors choose a sea career .. feeling whole and complete means feeling one with
nature. feel the wind through your hair and the fresh crisp air in your lungs, 
and the starry skies all around - -changing every day. at sea you can live a 
simple life, without the need to imitate others.in simplicity is the secret of 
true strength. real happiness is finding your lifework in the work that you 
love. ashore most are prisoner of golden handcuffs- - good salary , good house 
etc- attached to the life style. one of the simplest ways to brighten your mood 
at sea is to step into the sunlight and gaze into the blue waters or starry 
skies- for mental, emotional, physical and spiritual health. trust your gut , 
live a natural high every day.

SAY YES!-- TO THE SEA!

respect the sea--the sea will respect you!

TEA -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL

JAPANESE TEA CEREMONY – BODHI DHARMA-  SHAOLIN TEMPLE KUNGFU - URUMI SWORD- 
SWASTIKA TEA LEAF READING CUPS

this time when i was on leave,  i used to watch a programme on HISTORY CHANNEL.
it was about 2 professional american fighters, going to all corners of the world
to learn a martial art , say for 2 weeks. then one of them will challenge the 
top most fighter of that strain ( karate/ kungfu/ judo etc ). they were tough 
and no pushovers. i remember their names bill duff and jason. both were very 
likable characters , with no ego. they went to the top secret shaolin temple in 
china. they were afforded a peek into the forbidden for foreigners, inner 
sanctum ALONG with history channel video camera--the first time ever-- and guess
what-- BODHI DHARMA'S coloured portrait was there- with hairy barrel chest and 
all. in 520 AD this mallu , seen in picture above( speaking my mother tongue 
malayalam ) residing in kerala ( voted by natural geographic / word traveller --
 as one of the 5 top beautiful places on the planet ) , travelled to canton 
 china-- and there he taught the monks in shaolin temple--KALARI --  our ancient
 6000 year old martial art--- founded by warrior sage Parashurama.. today they 
 call it kung-fu there. all this is on camera-- the chief priest was proud to 
 admit. our swords were far superior -- 4 metres long -- double edged and serrated -- sometimes 4 pronged to stave off arrows -- worn around the waist like a belt-- laden with metallurgical poisons like mercury/ arsenic/ lead-- called URUMI

IT BROKE MACH ONE ( SPEED OF SOUND ) . ( no other weapon can do this!-- hence this deadly Urumi demoralises the enemy )

you can crack a whip--the crack is the edge of the whip breaking the sound barrier!

all you need was to nick and draw blood-- we still have it in our temples-- taken out on special occasions--

kalari warriors kept several tourniquets tied around their waist and knees, along with turmeric based blood clotting powder.

not many people know that bodhi dharma went into a meditative trance for 9 years, staring at a cave wall. once when he fell asleep, in a fit of self infliction , he cut off both his eyelids and threw them away.

the chinks watched that SPOT closely --and then took a plant which grew next to it and boiled it, hoping that they wont fall asleep , while meditating.

THIS IS THE TEA-- the whole world drinks. even today drinking tea is a meditative experience for all far east people--

nobody knows the reason for an elaborate tea drinking ritual – even today in japan etc.

japanese call bodhi dharma -- daruma.  

a tea ceremony is an aesthetic way of entertaining guests, in which everything is done according to an established order.  

the tea ceremony emphasized the following four qualities: harmony between the guests and the implements used; respect, not only among the participants but also for the utensils; cleanliness, derived from Shintō practices and requiring participants to wash their hands and rinse their mouths as symbolic gestures of cleansing before entering the cha-shitsu; and tranquillity, which is imparted through long and caring use of each article of the tea ceremony.

TEA LEAF READERS- - NEXT TIME READ IN A TEA BOWL WITH SWASTIKA PLACED AT THE BOTTOM.

AND BY THE WAY, IF THE BRITISH HAD TRADED OPIUM FOR COFFEE WITH CHINA INSTEAD OF TEA --  BRITAIN WOULD HAVE BEEN A COFFEE DRINKING NATION.

It is a LIE that the British introduced tea to India. We in Kerala have been growing tea ( chaya ) on the Wayanad Western Ghats since antiquity.  

The Arab middlemen of spices loved it . 

The commercial production of tea in India was started by the British East India Company and vast tracts of land in the NE of India have been exclusively developed into tea estates which produce various types of tea.

Grace and peace!

RESURRECTION OF SUN -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL

BIBLE-  BETHLEHEM - PYRAMIDS-  HORUS-  MOSES- 10 COMMANDMENTS

WE INDIANS WERE THE FIRST TO WORSHIP THE SUN-- the sun worshipping Vedic civilisation flourished on the banks of the river Saraswati from 9000 BC to 4000 BC

3 wise kings sitting on 3 camels follow the eastern star--

the 3 stars of " belt of orion constellation" ( alnitak/ alnilam/ mintaka ) aligns with the brightest star in the heavens , sirius ( canis major constellation ) on 25th Dec.  draw a straight line through theses 4 points-- and the sun rises there.

-- inside the great pyramids sun god osiris is orion, his consort isis is sirius . horus was their son--here it is jesus.

3 wise men reach bethlehem and see jesus born in the stable delivered by virgin mary.  stable to be read as between the goat and horse constellations.

### constellation virgo --house of bread.  virgin holds a sheaf of wheat.
   
 Of spica star. Bethelehem in Yiddish is house of bread.  when the new spring sun rose at pisces, virgo was standing on the western horizon, for it is exactly opposite to pisces in the zodiac.

jesus is crucified on the cross

### on 22nd dec , the sun is SETS under the southern cross ( 4 star constellation ) and is resurrected after 3 days

## after 3 days the sun rises-- and now days become longer than nights ( down from tropic of cancer and up from the tropic of capricon)

12 disciples of jesus-- one of them THOMAS , of doubting thomas fame, who came to kerala by ship , and built the first church ( this means kerala christians are senior to their counterparts ) -- peter went to vatican.

## equivalent to 12 signs of zodiac

moses provides the 10 commandments

## indian king manu provided the first laws of the planet ( search google )

moses flows down the river nile in a basket to avoid getting killed

## krishna flows down the river ganges in a basket. at least 5 more gods of other continents came down the river in a basket later!

moses comes down the mountain and kicks the butt of jews who worship the golden bull

## 0n 2150 BC the zodiac of taurius ( indian rishabham / aldebaran )) is over-- it existed only from 4300BC to 2150 BC -- the age from 2150 BC is aries, ( indian medam / hamal )) the ram till 1 AD.

jesus feed 2 fishes to 5000 folks

## from 1 AD to 2150 AD it is the age of pisces( indian eenam ) . Here is Krishna indicating Matsya avatar in 4000 BC.

equinoxial and ecliptic cuts at pisces , ( due to tilt of the earth at 23.5 degress ) --NOT aries-- so in nautical almanac it should be GHA pisces -- NOT GHA aries!!. this means modern navigation was lifted from somewhere between 2150 BC to 1 AD.

luke 22:10 last pass over-- follow the man with water pitcher

### from 2150 AD it is aquarius ( indian kumbam )-- a new age, new sunrise at spring equinox -- precession of the equinoxes--

constellations go backwards, than in the yearly cycle-- the zodiac cycle is 25765 years.

why 25765 years? If you take a spinning top and give it a push, it will begin to wobble in a manner called precession. The axis of the Earth makes a 25765 year wobble with an amplitude of tens of degrees. This is all due to the influence of the Moon's tidal attraction of the Earth

JESUS IS THE EQUIVALENT OF SUN -- THAT IS WHY THE CROSS AND THE HALO .

CIRCLE OF 12 ZODIACS IS SHOWN BEHIND HIS HEAD-- THE CROSS REPRESENTS THE 4 EQUINOXES.

pssst-- by the way, all have got it wrong when they said that the great pyramid at giza, has vent tunnels at 90 degrees to the kings chamber. the real reason is for his soul to shoot up exactly when the centre star alnilam ( belt of orion ) and north star lines up at each end. osiris ( orion ) was a god.

REAL WORK AND ACTIVITY TRAPS -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL

THE MEANING OF REAL WORK

the owner of the favourite restaurant of a big city went for a surprise visit.

for the past 6 months the hotel had CHANGED FROM A HUGE PROFIT MAKING
MACHINE TO A LOSS MAKING UNIT--he wanted to check out why- personally.

the staff and cooks were the same--- the only change was the new sprightly
manager of the restaurant--who joined 6 months back.

the owner asked the manager --how is my hotel doing?--

manager says ,we have been accredited iso 49000 since i joined-- we have
4.99 marks in HMSA ( that is something like our own TMSA ) -- i have
streamlined the paperwork-- here are the pie charts--here are the trends
in colour-- here are the consumptions and the averages-- we have
centralised our accounts and purchases and economised on vegetables and
meats --here are the figures --this is the last inspection report of the municipality
--we scored 100%-- blah blah --he was on his own trip--

the owner got upset ,walked off and called the stewards--in private.
what do you think is the problem? why have all our regular customers
deserted us? why are the chairs empty?.

the stewards said--lot of them sat for half an hour and before cooks
could get the soup ready --they got up in a huff and cursed us and went
away. we are also resigning--we too don't like to stand here the whole
day picking our noses , waiting for the cows to come home --we are losing
out on tips--

then the owner went into the kitchen-- and found the cooks caught in THE
CHAKRAVYUH OF ACTIVITY TRAPS doing tabulations on A4 size papers ,
averages, inventories , cleaning, pressure testing pipes, stencilling ,
polishing pans and buttons of their tunics, testing fuel -- the whole
kitchen smelled of strong metal cleaner/ detergent instead of food--

he asked the chief cook who was walking past him in a tearing hurry--

----are you coming or going?

--the man says -WHAAA?

EXTREME EXAMPLE OF ACTIVITY TRAP-- A CHIEF ENGINEER OF A SHIP WHO HAS BRAINWASHED HIMSELF THAT-- THE PURPOSE OF HIS SHIP IS TO TAKE HIS MAIN ENGINES FROM POINT A TO POINT B.

how many of you have lost the plot and are caught in the chakravyuh of daily activity traps?

VEDIC PRACTISES IN MECCA -- AJIT VADAKAYIL

MECCA AND VEDIC PRACTISES-- AJIT VADAKAYIL

Mecca is distinct from other mosques all over the world – the practices followed within its portals are NOT the same as in other mosques all around the world. There are major similarities with ancient Vedic practices.

Fast is broken on Sankranti and Vinayaka Chaturthi only after sighting the moon at dawn. The crescent moon rises 50 minutes after sun rise after new moon.

The crescent moon is on the forehead of Siva. The flag of Islam has it. In Tamil Nadu the ancient Kabaaliswaran temple is a Shiva temple.

Where there is Siva there must be pure Ganga ( pure Zam Zam in the middle of a Mecca desert ).

Siva Lingam is a heavy black meteorite stone, from outer space , with mysterious powers and metaphysical energy to raise the Kundalini . A true lingam is so powerful that water has to drip on it to keep it in control.

The black stone in the SE corner of the granite structure at Mecca called Al Hajar Ul Aswad 30 cms in diameter, 5 feet above the ground .

It is the south eastern corner stone of Kaaba.   Here it is mirrored .  The auspicious end in Hinduism vaastu is the "Kanni moola" or NW corner.

In all temples Hindus face west while praying as the diety doors face east.

There were inscriptions in Sanskrit on the Kaaba stone.

Vedic practices require devotees to enter temples in seamless white sheets.

Vedic pradikshanam ( circumambulation ) is walking round 7 times, clockwise. Muslims cannot kiss the black stone which activate the 7 chakras of the human body any more, emulating the kiss it received from the prophet, as the stone was broken in the middle ages and is now held by silver clamps and nails . Devotees now point to it at eack of the 7 counter clockwise circuits around the stone.

The mysterious number 786 is sacred in Koran. Nobody has been able to explain what it is, though it is printed on all Arabic Korans.

Write OM symbol ( sound frequency 7.83 Hertz ) in Sanskrit and keep it facing a mirror and you can see like MAGIC the number 786 in Devanagri script.

Kaaba was a pilgrimage site for centuries, more from from the days on King Vikramaditya— even Guru Nanak ( a non muslim ) had been there .

Encyclopedia Britannica says Kaaba has 360 idols including a King Vikramaditya inscripted gold dish, in a temple chamber called Ishalayam.  King Vikramaditya ruled 7500 years before the birth of Islam. Idol worship is banned in Islam.

Indian muslims must read above words with an open mind. After all the ancient Vedic culture or way of life belongs to every Indian and the sub-continenent --NOT just Hindus.  Vedic culture existed 9500 years before the birth of Islam.

Saraswati civilisation at the banks of river Saraswati from 9000 BC to 4000 BC  is the cradle of world civilisation . Saraswati river dried up in 4000 BC due to tectonic shift blocking the Himalayan glacier source, causing an exodus of elite to Mesopotamia, Europe, Russia and all over India. Indus valley civilisation started after the Saraswati river dried up, and Yamuna started pouring into Ganges.

One of my Pakistani Second Engineers, who had done religious studies in Khandahar and in Iran for many years , told me that every time he went to Mecca his friends and relatives would gives him dozens of silk handkerchiefs , to rub on the black stone . And every time he spent some time hurriedly doing that , he would get whipped quite severely by someone who was paid to do this (to time usurpers )
  
Ibn Battuta accounts say that Calicut King Cheman Perumal had a head priest cum accounts in-charge at the Shiva Temple ( called PAGAN temple by the west ) at Mecca which was a watering oasis for the camels , enroute to Jerusalem and Petra.  

For whatever reasons, the disturbed King decided to make a trip to Mecca , as soon as he heard that Mohammed founded Islam and installed a black stone , on the SE corner of the Kaaba.  

He took a ship from Calicut to Salalah and form there went by caravan route to Mecca. He met Mohammed , and the Islamic grapevine says that he was impressed by Islam and got converted from Hindu to Muslim.   

The King’s court at Calicut does NOT record this conversion, though messages were sent fast by carrier pigeons and hawks. The Encyclopedia Islamia admits as much when it says: "Muhammed's grandfather and uncles were hereditary priests of the Kaaba temple which housed 360 Vedic idols!" The encyclopedia Britannica records ths too.  

Ibn Battuta tells that Cheraman Perumal gave some tangy Calicut ginger pickle to Muhammed who ate it with great relish. The Prophet distributed it among his companions too. I also received a piece to eat --Hakim reports in 'Al Musthadrak.

On the way back to Calicut, the king fell ill and was buried at Salalah, Oman ( some at Salalah say that he was killed ).. This is a pilgrimage centre, as the Muslims say that the Hindu king was converted by Mohammed to bear the Muslim name Tajuddin given to him by Hazrat Syedina Muhammadur Rasool.

After Mohammed the Prophet died in 632 AD , June 8th, his loyal disciple Malik Bin Dinar landed at Calicut by ship in 643 AD , after visiting the dargah of Tajuddin ( King Cheraman Perumal ) at Salalah, 
   
He had a letter in King Cheraman Perumal’s hand in Malayalam that he has given permission to Mohammad to build mosques in Kerala. So Malik Bin Dinar became the first Qazi of the first mosque at Kodungallur in Kerala. Kodungallur was the centre of festivals during the reign of Hindu king Cheraman Perumal.

Check out the video below--

Muslims substitute 786 for the phrase بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم bism illāh ir-raḥmān ir-raḥīm ("in the name of Allah, the compassionate, the merciful").

In the Bollywood movie Coolie Amitabh Bachchan has the brass tag 786, and his senior Islamic scholar coolie friend tells him that this number in Islam , is equivalent to OM mantra in Hinduism.

Mohammad was born in 570 A.D. He proclaimed Islam in 622 A.D and died in 632 A.D. That is to say out of a span of 62 years, Mohammad himself was a Muslim for the last 10 years. For the earlier 52 years he was a non-Muslim --a pagan .  And he spoke to Calicut King Cheraman Perumal in Malayalam, while eating Ginger pickle..

AMAZON NAVIGATION-- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL

BEFORE NAVIGATING IN THE AMAZON YOU MUST FIRST DEVELOP A HEALTHY RESPECT FOR THE RIVER. LEST YOU RUE AT LEISURE LATER.

THE AMAZON RIVER IS 4000 MILES LONG JUST A HUNDRED MILES SHORTER THAN NILE --THE WORDS LONGEST RIVER. BUT IT MORE THAN MAKES UP BY ITS SHEER STRENGTH AND VOLUME--- AMAZON POURS 2000 TIMES MORE WATER THAN THE NILE . ONE BY FIFTH OF THE FRESH WATER THE WORLDS OCEANS RECEIVE IS FROM THE AMAZON.

IT FLOWS EASTWARDS FROM THE SNOW CAPPED ANDES INTO THE NORTH ALTANTIC AND IS NAVIGABLE ALMOST ITS ENTIRE LENGTH. IT DEPOSITS APPROX 70 TONS OF SEDIMENT EVERY MINUTE AT ITS DELTA WHICH IS 100 MILES WIDE AND LESS SALINE 200 MILES INTO THE OCEAN. SMALL SIZE SHIPS REACH IQUITOS IN PERU 2300 MILES UPRIVER. FROM IQUITOS TO OCEAN THE LAND FALLS ONLY 300 FEET. LARGE OCEAN LINERS REACH MANAUS 1000 MILES UPSTREAM.

THE TIDAL INFLUENCE IS FELT AS FAR AS OBIDOS. AT ATACOATIARA WHERE WE BERTHED THE RIVER FLOWS DOWN STREAM ONLY. THE MAIN RIVER IS BROWN AND BORING. BUT IT DOES HARBOUR THE PRARUCU WHICH AT 8 FEET LENGTH IS THE WORLD’S LARGEST FRESH WATER FISH. 

THE TRIBUTARIES ARE AMAZING WITH CLEAR WATER, 2 FEET LONG PIRANHAS WITH ORANGE BELLIES, ANACONDAS , MONKEYS AND OVERHANGING TREES. MOST OF THESE PIRANHAS ARE VEGETARIANS UNLESS YOU WANT TO OFFER A BLOODY FINGER.

WHEN THE RIVER IS FLOODED THE CREST IS 50 FEET ABOVE NORMAL , THE SPRING EBB TIDES IN RAINY SEASON NOV TO JUNE ARE 6 KNOTS WITH HUGE UPROOTED TREES FLOATING DOWN WHOM YOU MUST DODGE. IF CAUGHT ON THE BOWS IT REDUCES SHIPS SPEED , IF YOUR PROPELLER HITS A TREE TRUNK YOU CAN HAVE A PROBLEM.

WHEN THE COASTAL FEATURES ARE SUBMERGED LAND CANNOT NOT BE RECOGNISED EASILY. TALL GRASS WHICH GROWS OUT OF WATER CAN ADD TO THE CONFUSION. THE GPS IS THE BEST BET. THE WGS 84 CORRECTION IS NEGLIGIBLE. DURING FLOODS ALL THE SNAKES MIGRATE TO HIGH GROUND AND IF YOU LIKE TO GET BITTEN BY SNAKES WHO ARE SHORT OF PATIENCE THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE AT.

SOMETIMES IN SEPT OR MARCH YOU CAN SEE THE POROROCA OR THE SPECTACULAR TIDAL BORE LIKE WE HAVE IN THE HOOGHLY RIVER—ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THIS ONE IS ABOUT 5 METRES HIGH AND ITS CREST IS WHITE FOAM AS IT FORCES ITS WAY 400 MILES UPSTREAM AT 40 KNOTS. IT CAN BE UNNERVING IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS. 
 

ALL TYPES ON INSECTS INVADE YOUR SHIP. SOME OF THEM ARE GOOD IN SELF DEFENCE. FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS A LARGE COCKROACH ABOUT 4 INCHES LONG WHICH IF YOU TRY TO TRAMPLE WILL SEND A SHARP QUILL THROUGH YOUR SAFETY SHOE SOLE INTO YOUR LEG. 

AND THERE IS THIS WORLD RECORD HOLDING 18 INCH HERMAPHRODITIC LEECH WITH A 6 INCH HYPODERMIC NEEDLE.  IMAGINE IT CAN HOLD 3 TIMES ITS OWN WEIGHT IN ONE FEEDING. IT BREATHES THROUGH ITS SKIN. AND ITS SALIVA CONTAINS ANTICOAGULANTS WHICH CAN BLEED YOU TO DEATH.




SOME BEETLES ARE ALLERGY CAUSING AND CAN SLAM SHUT YOUR EPIGLOTIS. I REMEMBER ONCE SAVING MY MATE’S LIFE WITH AN INSTANT SHOT OF CHLOR PHENERAMINE MALEATE INJECTION. BETTER TO HAVE ANTI MALARIA TABLETS. KEEP YOUR ACCOMODATION AND EVEN CARGO TANKS SHUT.

CLOUDS OF FIREFLIES AT NIGHT CAN BE SUCH A WONDERFUL SIGHT. OR DOZENS OF GREEN PARROTS DURING DAY. LIGHTNING IN THE SKY LOOKS LIKE ARTILLERY FIRE.

AT MANAUS RIO NEGRO HAS ITS CONFLUENCE WITH AMAZON AND STAINS IT WITH BLACK INKY ORGANIC MATTER. MALARIA , TYPHOID, HEPATITIS AND CHOLERA GERMS ARE WAITING TO TAKE YOU ON IN THIS NECK OF THE WOODS.





 


BUSINESS:

ENOUGH OF LORE. LETS GET TO BUSINESS. CROSS BARRANORTE OR THE NORTH BAR AT HIGH WATER ON A RISING TIDE. THE BOTTOM HERE IS SOFT MUD. BE CAREFUL IF THE SHIP IS POUNDING DUE TO SWELL IN WHICH CASE ALLOWANCES FOR UKC HAS TO BE MADE. THE TIDE SETS HERE IN A SW/ NE DIRECTION. FROM THE BA ADMIRALTY TIDE TABLE CALCULATIONS FOR SECONDARY PORT BARRANORTE YOU MUST SUBTRACT 2HRS 36 MIN FOR HW AND 3HRS 20 MIN FOR LW. THE DEEPEST PART OF BAR HAS SHIFTED TO 4 MILES SOUTHWARDS OF THE LIGHT SHIP . IT TAKES 2 HOURS TO CROSS THE BAR.

AFTER CROSSING THE BAR INWARDS YOU REACH A BOTTLENECK CALLED CURUA CHANNEL. SUBTRACT ONE HOUR FROM BARRANORTE BA ATT TIMES TO GET CURUA CHANNEL TIDAL TIMES. THE BUOYS THERE ARE OUT OF POSITION MOST OF THE TIME. SO BEFORE ARRIVAL ASK THE AGENTS TO SEND YOU THE LATEST BUOY POSITION. IN THIS L ( LIMA SHAPED BEND ) KEEP TO THE GREEN BUOY SIDE OFF BUOYS 6 8 AND 10 AT 25 TO 75 RATIO. THIS IS BECAUSE THE RED BUOY SIDE IS GETTING SILTED EASTWARD INTO THE CHANNEL . THE RED BUOYS 5 7 AND 9 CAN BE TRUSTED AS THEY ARE DEEP ANCHORED IN SILT AND CANNOT BE KNOCKED OVER.

THE THUMB RULE IS KEEP TO THE OUTER SIDE OF RIVER BENDS WHICH ARE ARE SCOURED DEEPER. THE SAME IS THE CASE WITH CURUA CHANNEL. 



YOU MUST KNOW WHICH SIDE THE CURRENT/ WIND WILL SET YOU. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO PASS ANOTHER SHIP AT CURUA CHANNEL. HERE IT IS ONE SHIP AT A TIME AS THERE IS NO SEA ROOM AT THE L BEND, THE ACTUAL USABLE CHANNEL BEING ONLY 2,5 CABLES WIDE. THE BUOYS ARE ONE MILE APART. YOU CAN TRUST GPS POSITIONS IN THE CURUA CHANNEL. TREE TRUNKS AND WEED CLUMPS AT NIGHT CAN DISORIENT YOU ON RADAR.

AGENT CAN ALSO FAX YOU THE LOCAL TIDE TABLE PAGES . THE PASSAGE FROM BARRA NORTE TO FAZENDINHA OR MACAPA PILOT STATION IS NON COMPULSORY PILOTAGE. IF YOU WANT A PILOT BECAUSE YOU DO NOT HAVE PROPER CHARTS YOU CAN EMBARK A PILOT AT SALINOUPOULIS OR ESPADARTE PILOT STATIONS WHICH IS 170 MILES FROM BARRA NORTE. 

THE PILOTS IN THE AMAZON CAN BE TRUSTED. THEY VERY RARELY LOOK AT THE CHART. THEY USE RADAR VRM MARKER TO SET CLEARING DISTANCES. FROM MACAPA ONWARDS IT IS COMPULSORY PILOTAGE UPRIVER. SHIP HAS TO ANCHOR AT MACAPA TO CLEAR THE PORT AUTHORITIES. THE HARBOUR MASTER ALSO HAS A VISIT. IF YOU HAVE ANY DAMAGE ON YOUR BOWS HE WILL HOLD A PROPER ENQUIRY. 


AT MACAPA WHEN DROPPING OUTWARD PILOT WITH TIDE FROM BEHIND , FULLY LOADED , LITTLE SEAROOM AND SMALL CRAFT AROUND---- BE CAREFUL. IF YOU HAVE TO WAIT , STEM THE TIDE SO THAT YOU CAN ANCHOR IF REQD . AFTER MACAPA INBOUND EVEN THE LARGE SCALE BRAZILIAN CHARTS ARE OF NO USE. ON PASSAGE FROM MACAPA TO ITACOATIARA TWICE WE FOUND OUR SHIP NAVIGATING HALF MILE DEEP INSIDE LAND . 

WHEN YOU WANT TO PASS ANOTHER SHIP IN THE RIVER BETTER CLARIFY ON VHF IN ADVANCE IF IT IS GOING TO BE RED TO RED OR GREEN TO GREEN.

WHEN YOU FINALLY COME OUT OF THE RIVER, AND HEAD INTO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN WILL BE A BIT TAKEN ABACK BY THE  LIMITED UKC INDICATED BY THE ECHOSOUNDER MACHINE , AND CLEAR CUM DISCOLOURED WATER SWIRLS ALONG THE SHIP SIDE.  NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, AS THIS HUGE MASS OF MUDDY WATER ORGINATES FROM THE SUBTERRANEAN UNDERWATER AMAZON RIVER .  THIS IS WHY THE WATER SALINITY IS VERY LOW AT THE MOUTH OF THE AMAZON,  EVEN IF YOUR SHIP IS TWO HUNDRED MILES AWAY INTO THE ALTANTIC OCEAN , WITHOUT SOLITON WAVE FORMATION-- MUCH AGAINST THE PROPERTIES OF WATER . 




( IN BLACK SEA TOO THERE IS AN UNDERWATER STREAM FLOWING INTO BLACK SEA, WHILE THE SURFACE CURRENT IS OUTWARDS.)


 
KEEP THE ENGINE ROOM SEA SUCTIONS ON HIGH. USE BOWTHRUSTERS WITH CAUTION ESPECIALLY IF VSL IS ON LIGHT DRAFT. YOU MUST HAVE A RELIABLE ECHO SOUNDER. THIS WAY YOU CAN REDUCE SQUAT WHEN REQUIRED.

GLOBAL WARMING AND GREENHOUSE GASES--CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL

--- if anybody thinks capt vadakayil is trying to be snide by talking about cows farting-- he is mistaken.

fart gas is nothing but pure methane CH4 --which has one carbon atom in the aliphatic hydrocarbon-- two carbon atoms make it ethane, and 3 makes it propane etc-- C1 to C4 is gas, C5 to C9 is car petrol, C10 to C18 is car diesel--

ships are blamed for global warming and green house effect, caused by ocean loss of petroluem etc---

NO!

go to google search and punch in " cows farting belching " and see the number of hits you get. if you can find a way to catch this gas and use it in the kitchen , in a economical manner -- you will get a nobel prize.

the cow lobby is very strong-- but they cant fool vadakayil , who has not given milk ( cow's ) to his own 2 children-- as it is harmful to humans. calcium can be obtained from food easily .

no animal drinks the milk of someother animal. only when the cow gives the milk VOLUNTARILY to its own calf-- THE FIRST MILK FLOW OF MAMTA INDUCED BY CALF -- is NOT toxic.

bollywood films are full of mamta or for the matter peepta right?  they even have a mamta music competition goin' on .

milk vacumed out by machines is toxic, as the brain of the cow releases toxic chemicals. ( plain difference between love and rape ). this subject is QUANTUM ENERGY.

even the calf is kicked off after the infantile stage. the simple and unselfish cow ( GAAY ) may not move when a speeding lorry approaches it --but it does care deeply for its own calf.

that is why we indians worship the cow.

recently i had written to all the indian TV channels NDTV / times now / CNN-IBN etc , what nonsense is this about mumbai citizens putting off electricity for one hour enmasse and changing bulbs to cfls'. global warming and green house effect is caused by methane / CO2 gases etc --- NOT by heat of bulb.

milk or saturated fat is harmful . most indians have lactose intolerance after the age of THREE , that is why we pass wind if we drink too much whole milk --( curd is not harmful--it is friendly anaerobic bacteria ).

stomach lining cells are 100% replaced in 4 days. it is contained in the texture of the stools. 

indians use tongue cleaner because our yogis knew 6000 years ago that tongue cells are renewed every 8 days.

true yogis never drank milk.

ABOVE WISDOM IS NOT REQUIRED FOR RUNNING A SHIP-- BUT IT IS MOST
IMPORTANT FOR YOUR OWN BIOLOGICAL AGE -- AND YOUR PLANET!

this is probably the most important piece you would have read in a long time or will read in future.

DYNAMICS-- AJIT VADAKAYIL

--- let me briefly explain company core value of dynamics. it is this core value--which prompted me to say ENOUGH-- don't send the same 2nd engr for the 5th time back on my ship.

always keep a window open for some fresh air and light to come in.

CHANGE IS THE ONLY CONSTANT ON THIS PLANET.

last vacation i had written a piece on HUMAN CLONING -- and sent it to some international organisations who can make a difference -- to save the word from dolly syndrome.

my message was "don't clone yourself , even if you are god's gift to mankind". everything may seem perfect now -- but tomorrow you will realise that  you have been 100% wrong.

THIS IS WHY "BONDING WIRE" AT TANKER MANIFOLD GAVE WAY TO "INSULATED
FLANGE" . a sheer 180 degrees turn-- without batting an eyelid.

THIS IS WHY IN FIRST AID MANUALS NOW , AFTER A DIWALI SKIN BURN THEY
SAY-- COOL IT IT WATER-- DON'T JUST PUT A DRY GAUZE - - a sheer 180 degrees turn.

this will be best stated by this glaring example--

in 1983 came back from long leave to command a crude supertanker loading at saudi arabia deep sea rastanurah terminal every 11 days .

those days the iran-iraq war was in full swing-- our ships used to have HIND logo emblazoned on black shipside in white arabic-- writing used to be about 80 metres long.

those days , company policy was STOP DURING DAYLIGHT OUTSIDE WAR ZONE --STEAM AT FULL SPEED DURING DARK THROUGH WAR ZONE.

it just took one angry phone call from a young-- unquenched-- bad boy vadakayil to the chairman of the company ( who was my fan ) -- for the policy to get reversed after 4 months ( -- during which 3 of our huge tankers and one VLCC ( masters arm got hit ) had got hit by iranian heat seeking missiles.)

i had told him bluntly -- i wont follow stupid policies made by pea-brained men!

the new policy became--

STOP AT NIGHT OUTSIDE WAR ZONE , STEAM DURING DAY THROUGH WAR ZONE.

wise-- because after that our tankers never got hit-- for india was neutral. we were closer to iran than to iraq.
dynamics-- the name of the game-- gentlemen!

--by the way—

DYNAMICS MEANS , “TEAM DYNAMICS” — IT IS ABOUT NATURAL FORCES LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IN A SOCCER GAME --

it is not about progress or change --

--or whatever--

PERFECT BLACK BODY -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL

PERFECT BLACK BODY — BY CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL

Indians worshipped a black extra-terrestrial stone SHIVA LINGUM -- since the past 9000 years.

inside Mecca ( muslims ) the core is a BLACK BODY stone.

Inside Jerusalem “Dome of the rock” -- ( christians/ jews/ muslims ) the core is a BLACK BODY stone.

Black is a good radiator and also a good absorber-

-- why has ooperwaala or the good lord made people living in tropics black-

why arab women are forced to wear black ( to keep them indoors in the shade ) and men wear white ( they are in the hot sun all the time )?

On my ships I paint my monkey island silver or the return steam line black.

it makes sense to have a silver coloured car in India, for if your car is black you need to fit 2 AC's. on a hot day you can fry an egg on a black car.

Indian women since 6 millenniums always wore kaajol or kohl or LAMP BLACK on their eyes- not to make them look attractive - but for scientific reasons--

Lampblack absorbs all radiant energy falling on it.

All incident visible light will be absorbed rather than reflected---

--and THEREFORE ( aaaha!!!! ) the surface will appear black-- perfect absorber of energy this BLACKBODY.

Make a small hole in a box with lamp blackened interior, only 98% of the radiation entering such a hole could escape out ever again. If the inside was polished silver-like mE silver monkey island it would absorb
only about 6 percent of the incident radiation, reflecting the rest.

Kaajol is made by the impingement of smoky flames from TINY jets on iron channels ( like cracks on an incinerator refractory ) , the deposited black is then scraped .

About one fourth of the weight of a formula one race car or even a ordinary oil truck tire is carbon black, to avoid building up an electrostatic charge, to make the rubber electrically conducting and to make the tire radiate heat away- lest it melts.

Blackbody, absorbs all the radiation that strikes its surface, regardless of its wavelength-- and is called a blackbody because it reflects no light.

No such perfect / ideal object is known to exist on this planet ( except SHIVA LINGUM in indian temples ), although a surface consisting of carbon black may absorb all but about 3 per cent of incident radiation.

In theory, a blackbody is thus a perfect emitter of radiation , and at any specific temperature it emits the maximum amount of energy available from a radiating body through temperature alone.

If a object looks white, it is because all or nearly all of the radiation is reflected.

Recapitulation: an object that absorbs all the radiation striking it is known as a blackbody.

This is why a perfect black body like shiva lingum must be kept continuously quenched by drops of water dripping on it.

IN ALL SOUTH INDIAN TEMPLES THE IDOL IS SMALL AND BLACK--WHICH RADIATES AND EMITS ENERGY.  (In North Indian temples they have huge white statues--passing of a holy idols)
*********************************************************************************
SRI YANTRA ,108 AND THEORY OF EVERYTHING -- AJIT VADAKAYIL

THE UNIVERSAL MIND ,  THE FRACTAL GEOMETRIC DESIGN OF THE UNIVERSE, THE  SRI YANTRA

 

In August 1990 a huge 2D Sri Yantra was inscribed overnight on a dry lake bed in USA Oregon and spotted by a National air guard plane from Idaho. 


It was NOT the usual corn field crop circle which form when scalar waves meet matter. 


The lines engraved were 13.3 miles long , 10 inches wide and 3 inches deep in soft mud , when measured. 


There were no footprints or tyre marks in the soft mud-- unlike the quintessential corn crop circle which cannot record footprints.





It is very hard to draw a perfect Sri Yantra on a piece of paper — leave alone a massive lake bed.





The cymatic 3D inscription ( sound vibration conversion to visual patterns ) of OM in pure water is the ancient vedic Sri Yantra. It abundantly shows that microscopic forces that define the structure of water is not fully known .





Here is the OM crop circle ( several square miles in area )






OM , the original one letter King mantra is a prayer in itself. Within your cells, the organizing DNA double helix structure and its RNA message carriers dance to the mantra. 


OM opens up quantum tunneling where the wormholes do not have speed of light restriction. DNA is a superconductor that stores light at body temperature, and can create magnetic wormholes in ZPF .. Microtubules and axional membranes are also hollow cylinders.








The Sanskrit Vedas tell that Sound is the heart of all existence. Sound preceded all that we see. So powerful and all-pervasive, and yet we pay very little attention to it, and so often confuse it with noise. Sanskrit is a divine language unlike other languages of the world. When the vowels of this language is pronounced the shape on the tonoscope is the written symbol.


The sign OM is not a ordinary mortal inscription. When Om is chanted the proper way the inscription can been seen in the mind. 786 the divine Islamic number is what you see when OM is seen in the mirror. 


According to the Upanishads--the ancient scriptures of India, the original abode of the mantra was the primeval ether. The human body is hard wired to respond to OM sound , the nucleus of spiritual energy, and there is no off switch. 

The hermetic axiom “all is vibration” is scientifically true since matter is made of electromagnetic waves. Matter, contrary to our eyes, is actually four-dimensional. Teleportation is the removal of an object from third dimensional space, whereby it takes a shortcut through the fourth dimension before being inserted back into third.





Sri Yantra which follows the Fibonacci series and the Golden ratio ( lifted from Vedic Mathematics )  is the mystical 3D holographic construct of the Cosmos by 9 VIRTUAL SPIRALLING VORTEX CONES — 4 pointing upwards and 5 pointing downwards, as a sort of ying-yang balance. 



Fibonacci series ( from Bejaya Algeria where he read a translated copy ) was lifted from the work of the great Indian mathematician Pingala in 5th century BC, under the series Matra Meru



Energy in a vortex acts as a frequency converter. Our brain stores information in a holographic form. A zero point field has electromagnetic counter rotating energy spirals which interconnects with the larger macroscopic cosmos through which consciousness manifests into space-time-matter. 












The great pyramid of Cheops Egypt has a base angle 51 deg 49 minutes like the 10000 year old Sri Yantra large pyramid, showing exactly the same relationship between pi and phi . The ratio of the hypotenuse to half the base is phi, the Golden Ratio-- or 'divine proportion', given by (1 + square-root 5)/2 (its value to five decimal places is 1.61803). It is a sure indication that the Pharaoh's architects were NOT from Egypt.


The secrets of Cosmic unity are held by the inter-penetration of 9 triangles to form 43 smaller triangles. 


The Sri Yantra is traditionally held by 12 strand DNA Vedic rishis to have been divinely revealed around 8000 BC. These super-men with fractal minds could see numerical problems as FRACTAL geometry


The Saraswati civilisation which flourished on the banks of river Saraswati from 9000 BC to 4000 BC is the cradle of the Vedic culture.


The Sringeri temple ( 335 kms from Bangalore ) has a perfect Sri Yantra. 


In 2D on a membrane with lycopodium powder layer it forms the complex geometrical figure as below –





to understand in 2D -- out of 9 interlacing triangles, 5 point downwards and 4 point upwards, to form 43 triangles. 





All triple intersections meet at the same point. The vertices of the largest triangles fall on the circumference of the enclosing circle. Except for the two biggest triangles, all apexes touch the base of another triangle. The central triangle facing downwards must be equilateral and holds the Bindu of the holistic pyramid . 

The Bindu is also the centre of the circle . The 3 lines intersect at 54 points ( number of sanskrit alphabets ) with shiva and shakti qualities making the magic number 108..


BINDU is the witness or consciousness.


108 is the numerical equivalent of OM , in sync with the rhythms of time and space and represents perfect totality.





Even in Islam 108 represents god. 54 devas and asuras had churned for the amrit or holy nectar. All mantras are repeated 108 times. All prayer beads count up to 108. 





There are 108 upanishads. Nataraja's cosmic dance has 108 Bharatanatyam poses. 






12 rashis and 9 navagrahas multiply to 108. 



Sun's diameter is 108 times that of the earth.  



The distance between the Earth and Sun is 108 times the diameter of the Sun . 

The distance between earth and moon is 108 times the diameter of the moon..  





Ayurveda and Kalari talks about 108 marmas.  










Shiva, Ganesha and Krishna has 108 names. Japanese welcome new year with 108 chimes.


The 108 th and heaviest element in the periodic table is Hassium ( 108 protons ) . The rest are too short lived.




The super genius Nikola Tesla would repeatedly see the bright geometric form of the Sri Yantra.


This overwhemed his sight and blotted out the scenes in front of him.


Italian Fibonacci of 1200 AD is given the credit of the Golden ratio, while the Indian Sri Yantra based on Golden ratio of 1.618 was drawn in 8000 BC --see video below.

 








A copper portrait of Sri Yantra in your pooja room is like drawing the etheric energy of ancient temples to your home by resonant coupling. It spirals into your chakras , resonates your pineal gland and corrects the aura and cleans unwanted energy interference. It is connected deeply with the Ancient Art of Vaastu and has been specifically mentioned in the 'Vaastu Shastra'. 

The Vedas explain Shree Yantra as a scientific, cosmic and planetary energy zone. Gazing at the Sri Yantra connects the RH lobe of brain with the LH , thus improving mental performance.


A perfect mystical ice Shiva linga has the Sri Yantra in the form of a dome. 




Our eyes see only a small portion, about one octave, of the vast electromagnetic "Light Keyboard". 







As we move down the "Light" keyboard from the visible, the wavelengths become longer, greater distances; the light wave names are Infrared, Microwave, Radio shortwave, and Radio longwave. The Extremely Long Waves and beyond are the waves that represent the vibrations of the Moons, Planets, Suns and Galaxies. 

If we move up the "Keyboard of Light" from the visible, the wavelengths become shorter and shorter; Ultraviolet, X-Rays, Gamma Rays, and Cosmic Rays. These shorter waves are the building energies of matter, the vibrations of Molecules, Atoms, Protons, Electrons and other names that we give the sub-atomic energy vibrations. 


Each of the planetary and stellar bodies acts as a spherical receiver, transmitter and reflector of the electromagnetic long wavelength light energies in similiar manner to a satellite communications dish antenna.


Non linear, longitudinal, field like , Scalar waves constitute a kind of ocean of infinite energy, and it has now been discovered that this abundant energy can be coaxed to pour into our 3-dimensional world from their 4-dimensional realm, to be used to do work, provide electricity, power all transport, and even heal the body of almost all disease. This is the the zero-point energy, the energy of the absolute nothingness which existed before the world began.





Sri Yantra is the chariot of ascension for transporting consciousness to higher dimensions. The Sri Yantra’s 3 dimensional geometrical pattern contains the elusive Theory Of Everthing ( TOE ) which interlinks gravity and antigravity to the other fundamental forces of nature. 


This cosmic consciousness pranic diagram contains the 11 dimensions, the ultimate periodical table of elements and E8 root structure which is inclusive of the double helix DNA , quarks, anti-quarks, leptons, neutrinos, excitons, plasmons , solitons ,mesons, hadrons, gluons, W-bosons, photons, gravitons ,electrons, nuclear forces , scalar waves , akashic torsion field records , dark energy, time, space etc. 



These are the 11 Dimensions.
0. No Dimension (Bindu- Nothing)
1. a Line (Length)
2. a split (Height)
3. a Fold (Breadth)
4. a line ( Time)


5. a split (Choosing a timeline)
6. a fold ( Jumping from one timeline to another eg. time travel
7. a point ( A point of all possible timelines and hence INFINITY) (INFINITY)
8. a line ( Different infinities different from our own big bang. Different universe with its own infinities and dimensions eg. a 2D character cannot live in its own universe without having a clue what 3D is)) 
Hence Joining this line from One Universe of infinities from the 7 dimension and joining it to another universe which would for the 8th Dimension
9. a fold (Travelling from one universe of different dimensions to another eg. a 2D character travelling to a 3D world)) It would disappear and be taken to a totally different universe that it could have never imagined))
10. a Point ((Taking all the possible infinities of all possible dimensions and all possible infinite universes and bringing it to a point.. This is where we start over again and cannot think of anything more than that))
11. Bindu or God

So if we started off with a point which is nothing and ended off with a point which is everything then
ALL = NOTHING 


To understand why all this exists would be to know the mind of God. 


A superior intelligent being resides with our DNA holding the highest state of intellectual consciousness and awareness .






The musical analogies of maths , physics , chemistry, quantum particles and contained in this diagram in the form of notation, harmony , melody and notes. The mind of god represented by the Sri Yantra is cosmic music resonating through hyperspace.


The heat of the big bang cooked up and created the elements in Dimitri Mendeleev's periodic table.




Mendeleev has expressed his thanks to Panini who was Sanskrit's grammarian 2800 years ago . Mendeleev had said that there are ultra rare AETHER gases preceeding Hydrogen on his periodical table. Nikola Tesla always believed that electrical and magnetic forces were streams of Aether gas ( Akasha , as explained to him to him by Vivekananda ) Gravity does not pull as contended by Newton of apple bump on head fame. Rather it pushes, due to the depression or warp in the time space fabric. The faster you move the slower time progresses.


A visible attribute of consciousness is an energetic field that governs the shaping of organisms Consciousness is the creative force of the entire universe or GOD. 


Kundalini Crop circle ( 8000 year old Indian Hindu symbol ) --





and the 7 chakras --










Indeed everything manifests from primordal vibration.


The universe is a hologram as per our 10000 year old Sri Yantra which contains the Theory of Everything.  Our universe has NO beginning and stretches out infinitely like the Klein bottle.  There is NO big Bang as this requires a place to bang it from.  Rather it is inhalation and exhalation.


A hologram is basically a three-dimensional image of an object laser-imprinted onto a two-dimensional surface, which has length and width, but no depth — in other words, a flat surface, like a sheet of paper. The 3-D image appears when light hits the 2-D surface at a cetain angle.  Although they look very different, both the 3-D image and the flat 2-D surface are depictions of the same object.



When the western countries, came out from the quaternary ice age in 9500 BC, and were staying in caves, eating raw meat and doing grunt grunt, India was a great civilization, with kings staying in palaces, wearing silk and writing poetry in Sanskrit. An employee German Max Mueller working for German Jews Rothschild, the owner of opium running British East India company, was told by Vatican to subvert world history to prove to all, that Bible dates are right. That the big bang of cosmos happened in 23rd Oct 4004 BC, 9 AM ( while it happened 14 billion years ago ) and that the great flood with Noah’s arc and party happened in 2500 BC ( life came on earth 4 billion years ago ) . 

By 5000 BC, the Indian Rig Veda was written in Sanskrit. Every religion and prayer on this planet is an offshoot of Hinduism and every language is an offshoot of Sanskrit. The Aryans went out of India, with their Swastika symbol ( inscribed on Shiva's son Ganesha's palm ) as modern DNA tests have proved, never into India, as contended by Hitler . The Indian Dravidian Anahata Chakra 6 point star has been adopted by Jewish religion. Shiva Lingam stones of ex-pagan temples are the main attraction at Mecca Kaaba , Dome of the rock at Jerusalem and Vatican.

INDIGO CHILDREN WITH THIRD EYE -- AJIT VADAKAYIL








INDIGO CHILDREN WITH THIRD EYE - AJIT VADAKAYIL




Play above video whle you read this post. 
INDIGO CHILDREN do not think within their mental structuring in linear/ vertical form , but laterally -- rather holographically. 


An Indigo child has an aura colour of INDIGO. They have broader 5 senses than others. They are living demonstrations of the dormant abilities , which ancient vedic time Indian Yogis had.


Their perceptive abilities use, till now , dormant areas of brain matter , due to genetic change. This type of thinking brings high intelligence. 


Indigos have innate healing abilities , due to their superior DNA pattern. This DNA has figure of 8 loop , 12 strand ( like the mobius coil ) which can biologically generate and emit SCALAR waves, also known as Reiki waves, which travel faster than light through any medium without losing strength science, has yet to discover the full spectrum of DNA imprinting function or the direct connection between DNA and consciousness.


Indigo children do NOT have junk DNA .  You have 96% junk DNA in your body.


The spiraling double length of DNA material is much more than simply a tool for your evolutionary physical process to remember from one generation to the next -- (a new born kitten will also dig a hole, prior to a crap) . It is a Cosmos communication satellite that has been dormant for thousands of millennia. 


Indigo children are mediums , with very high gamma brain wave activity >40 Hz , and superior DNA signaling , for access to higher communication and telepathy. 


Indigo is the color of the "third eye chakra," . This chakra regulates clairvoyance, or the ability to see energy, visions and spirits.


Sixth chakra of the body from below , is the Third Eye Chakra. It aids the pitutiary gland whose hormones control other glands and brain — it resonates with indigo colour —- strengthens wisdom, clairvoyance, imagination . 


They display rare abilities , advanced genius and psychic/telekinetic abilities and other extra-ordinary attributes. 


Indigo Children have biological, mental, spiritual skills and abilities that are advanced, as compared to that of the norm. Indigos process their emotions differently than non Indigos because they have high self-esteem and strong integrity. 


They can read you like an open book and can quickly unearth any hidden agendas or subtle attempts to manipulate them. In fact, they can see your hidden agendas even if you can't! 


They have no patience for everyday pettiness. These children are highly intuitive. They see all that is, and perceive all at once. 


They have inherently strong determination to work things through for themselves and only want outside guidance if it's presented to them with respect and within a format of free choice. They prefer to work situations out for themselves.


They are fast on the uptake only if they are drawn to a subject, which makes them very advanced in their areas of interest. These children respond best when treated like a respected adult.


Psychological "button pushing" by society often causes them to be labeled as mavericks and nonconformists. 


They fight the untruths and do not recognize structure as is normal for the lesser mortals.


They are at risk within the present sociological atmosphere. Many of them , due to intelligent dreaming are mis-diagnosed and inappropriately treated as cases of Schizophrenia, Bi-polar Disorder, etc. Medical and psychiatric communities do not yet recognize the symptoms , causes and remedies for the biological, perceptual, psychological and spiritual sensitivities characteristic to advancement of the human genetic code.


Few Indigo children were born on earth from 1988 to 1997, when Saturrn , Uranus and Neptune were in conjunction.


#########
The most common traits of Indigo Children :


-- They feel and act superior and get surprised when others don’t recognise it. They know who they are and are not afraid of telling so..


-- They wont suffer foolish and absolute authority , they would rather choose.


-- They wont follow the rest –like standing in a queue or rituals that have NIL creative thought.


-- They are "system busters" as they can see facile ways to do usual things. They are internally rebellious. They want to CHANGE the world and the system, and wont take the beaten track.


-- They are aloof at school as they don’t see much of intelligence around and don’t care for learning by rote and repetition. They get frustrated when they see big brother watching and manipulating them. They hate dishonesty and can sense it.


-- They want to be leaders—they wont like to be part of a stupid team, and hence prefers to work or play alone. They are ready and determined warriors to cut down the system which lacks integrity.


-- Have psychic and spiritual interests at a early age—and have belief in their intuition—and are GIVERS.


-- Indigo children usually get poor grades in conventional schools due to their rejection of authority, being smarter than their teachers and a lack of response to guilt-traps, fear- or manipulation-based discipline.


-- They can multitask and think abstractly. 


-- They are at extremes— nothing in between . Can have rage as they wont express anger inwards.


#############


Indigo is a higher vibratory aspect of blue -- indigo provides an entry to the astral world as it is the colour of deep emptiness, travel into the self, ancient memories, primordial secrets , sixth sense and deep intuition .


Indigo is one of the best pain killers and the MOST visible colour. It heals the etheric body and etheric template. It strengthens the pituitary gland . It is an astringent and purifier. Indigo is also used to enhance psychic awareness and clarity of divination. 


If you cover your body with indigo colour no fly of mosquito will come near you. 


Psychic abilities to read the Akashic records are real, and indeed everything that has every happened in this world is written in the vacuum fabric of space and time. 


Human consciousness is able to read this book of life.


The Vedic sages were Indigo children with 12 strand DNA and king size resonating Pineal glands. The Vedic civilisation flourished from 9000 BC to 4000 BC on the banks of the river Saraswati, till the river dried up due to an earthquake blocking the glacial mouth at the Himalayas.

GOLD FINGER -- AJIT VADAKAYIL









ENERGY AND “ GOLD FINGER” TERRORISM- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL



A few years ago my chemical tanker ship docked at Bejaya in Algeria. No shore leave was possible due to tight anti-terrorism security. ( It is from Bejaya that Fibonacci took the secrets of ZERO and Indian numerals to Europe ). A year ago some terrorists came by boat on a ship at anchorage and shot dead all the crew, for no reason.


I had one on one conversations with few intelligent local people. They said terrorism is Algeria will stop only after all the natural gas has been bled from the country by the white man. Algeria has one of the biggest gas deposits in the world under its desert sands. 




I remembered the Ian Fleming 007 James Bond book GOLD FINGER where the entire gold in Fort Knox would have been radiated , to keep it safe .


History shows that where ever costly minerals were found in Africa the poor locals lost their blood and suffered endlessly. 


Energy is the reason for terrorism and violence in Iraq , Nigeria , Libya and many other countries. 




And now Uranium and Thorium rich Somalia has joined the list too. 


Since India has the worlds best Thorium reserves, the white man is tripping over each other to offer us OBSELETE Uranium powered nuclear reactors. This is like trying to palm off a useless 20 year old MS DOS laptop to you , so that you will NOT buy the latest processor model . 




Our president Abdul Kalam had told on national television years back that India must develop Thorium based nuclear reactors. Thorium contains 150 times more energy than Uranium and is the MOST efficient combustible . It is found along with actinides Uranium and Plutonium in the Periodic table. Since Thorium is only slightly radio active , it is clean with no burden of nuclear waste disposal.

 


Lead derived from Thorium has higher atomic weight that lead derived from Uranium. Ordinary lead , Uranium derived lead and Thorium derived lead are physically , chemically and spectroscopically identical. Xrays which vibrate at 400000000 billion to 6000000000 times per second are chemical light phenomenon produced by Gamma rays of Uranium and Thorium.



After extraction from ore, thorium does not require energy-intensive enrichment as is the case with uranium. A thorium-powered reactor is inherently safe. It doesn't run the risk of "meltdown" or explosion nor can even a dirty bomb be created. Its nuclear reaction simply stops when its neutron exciter is turned off. 



A thorium powerpack's neutron excitor does not use radioactive flux components as conventionally done for portable systems. It works of resonant phonon pair cleavage using specifically designed nuclear lattice holo-forms (holographic waveforms) to induce neutron imbalance in a host atom where the host atom then attempts to establish "balance" through the liberation of neutrons. 



Commercial thorium powerpacks can be developed with 50 or 100 kilowatts of output for home use, and up to 1 megawatt for industrial use. They actually are "power amplifiers" with power outputs of 60 times over input power. Maintenance would be minimal. 





Bombardment of thorium-232 by slow neutrons yields the fissile isotope uranium-233. This process is comparable to the process by which fast neutrons “breed” fissile plutonium-239 from nonfissile uranium-238.. The thorium-uranium fuel cycle is being studied by scientists as an alternative to the uranium-plutonium fuel cycle. 


When you bombard the slightly radioactive heavy metal thorium 232 with neutrons, you convert it to fissionable uranium 233. Instead of water, the reactor circulates thorium tetrafluoride fuel through the reactor core dissolved in molten lithium and beryllium fluoride salts. 

A small amount of U233—supplies the neutrons that cause fission. Excess neutrons fly off into a surrounding blanket of molten thorium salt to convert more thorium into new U233 fuel, which can then be used to keep the reaction going. 

Because the molten salt expands when heated, it is inherently safe. The lower density fuel won't support a continuing nuclear reaction. Every stage of this process—fuel loading, neutron management, fuel separation, heat exchange, refueling, and waste separation—has been successfully tested in actual US reactors.



A few years ago my ship docked at Munguba inside one of the minor tributaries ( Jari )of the mighty Amazon river. We were to load Kaolin. I asked a few locals , why Kaolin out here in this god forsaken neck of the woods? 





It so transpired that the Yanks found gold out there about 50 years ago— they made a smoke screen by planting fast growing Eucalyptus trees . They stole all the gold and opened kick back bank accounts for a few Brazilian ministers in USA. And while they were doing all this they stumbled on to Kaolin.

THE INDENTURED COOLIE, SLAVERY REINVENTED -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL

WE FIND STUPID INDIANS CRYING FOR THE FAKE 6 MILLIONS JEWS OF THE HOLOCAUST.

90 MILLIONS HINDUS – YES - 90 MILLION -- WERE SLAUGHTERED – AND NOBODY CARES .
  
ENCYCLOPEDIAS DID NOT RECORD IT, TILL THIS BLOGSITE FORCED THEM TO  .
  
THIS 90 MILLION DOES NOT INCLUDE THE FAMINE DEATHS  IN INDIA –DELIBERATELY INTRODUCED IN SUCH A FERTILE COUNTRY..

9.8 million Indians  died in the great DELIBERATE famine of 1769- -deliberately starved by Rothschild controlled East India company employee Warren Hastings , who wanted Opium , Indigo and Jute for export instead of food.

Nobody talks about the great DELIBERATE Guntur famine in 1832 to make people lose hope and force them to migrate as Indentured labour in foreign lands .  Rothschild planned two years in advance as in 1834 Black slavery was abolished and replaced by Indian Indentured labour.

Nobody talks about the great DELIBERATE Orissa famine caused by Rothschild in 1866 / 67 where 5.8 million Indians died of starvation .There was mass exodus and indentured labour to foreign lands

Nobody talks about the great DELIBERATE famine in India of 1876–78 where 6.3 million Indians died , while 61 million Indians starved . Again there was mass exodus to foreign lands as indentured labour.

We Indians are more familiar with the DELIBERATE famine in 1943 ( Bengal ) for which Amartya sen got the Nobel prize when 5.2 million Indians died.   Rothschild screwed the Bengali clan of Subhash Chandra Bose who dared to jump from British camp to Jap camp in the middle of WW2

THE INDENTURED COOLIE , SLAVERY REINVENTED -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL


Some push us around, some curse us
Where is our splendor and prestige ?
The whole world calls us black thieves. 
The whole world calls us “coolie.”
Why doesn’t our flag fly anywhere?
Why do we feel low and humiliated?
Why is there no respect for us in this world?


-- 200 year old Indian immigrant song





My first introduction to indentured labour was in 1975 when as a young third officer my ship was navigating off Suriname. I had the DF on MW and heard Hindi and Bhojpuri mix with a strange accent on radio . 





Seeing my puzzled look, my old quarter master told me that half the population of Suriname are the descendants of Indentured labor from India . He told me a few shocking stories narrated to him when he was a young strapping sailor by Lascars. 




Now lascar is also a derogatory term like coolie—only difference being Lascar is Indian sailor scum who worked under European officers on olden sailing tall ships.





Since then whenever my ship went to lands where Indian indentured labour worked two centuries ago , I made it a point to get information . Countries like Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad, Jamaica, South Africa, Mauritius, Fiji, Reunion , Kenya , Tanzania, Malaya etc had the bulk of Indian labour.





Most of the time it would be Government servants of Indian origin like Immigration, Customs, port Health, agents etc who visited the ship for arrival formalities. The young lot only knew that they were Indians , almost all of them used Bollywood movies to be in touch with their roots. 





These countries have destroyed all history of indentured labour , even in their history text books of school. The idea was to destroy their psyche and to destroy the fountainhead of spirit.. I had specific questions for them about their wretched history and they would come back and tell after consulting their nostalgic grandparents. 




Such interaction invariably rekindled something inside their DNA and they hoped to visit India to trace their roots and culture. All of them were happy and privileged to speak to an original Indian from the motherland.




Around 1834 the English speaking white man abolished slavery. He then reinvented slavery in the form of Indentured labour from India. It was a worse form of slavery. Attractive ,glowing , blushing , dark skinned young Indian women , now came into the equation.






It was a win-win situation for the sailors on ships on the long 20 week voyage and the white colonial masters and overseers in the destination country. After all the black slave women could not hold their interest.






Recruiting agents in India called Arkatia ( the hook ) were paid a handsome some for good looking native women. Invariably the naive protector husbands, fathers or brothers of such women would mysteriously fall overboard, get killed or get missing. 

 These gullible males used to be promised cushy supervisory jobs and handsome wages and the promise that the promised land is just over the horizon. Some women were just kidnapped and shanghaied. Some were child widows who had nothing to lose. 









All were duped into signing ( thumb printing ) extensive 5 year contracts with vague terms and conditions in English, which they could not understand. The British government in India and even the Christian missionaries did nothing to stop this blatant mass deception. Sometimes just before sailing women would be secretly separated from their husbands and put on the next ship. 




A lot of women died of venereal diseases. A lot men and children died on the sea passage due to dysentery, typhoid, malnutrition etc. The ships doctor would be given a bonus for every person delivered alive. 


The survivors of the terrible sea voyage kala paani ordeal, sitting , sleeping and eating amidst their own waste, identified themselves with the ship they travelled and forged a sense of unity and strong bhai—behen bonds, with only their religion , culture and festivals for spiritual resilience and support.







More than a million Indentured Indians landed in the Caribbean itself. A lot of them were cotton and Indigo workers whose industries were destroyed by the British East India company (owned by Rothschild German Jews).  





Prime fertile land was earmarked for growing opium, to be sold in China for massive profits.  An onerous taxation system forced many starving farmers off their land. Vague records were maintained. 




Most of the indentured labour were from UP, Bihar, Orissa, Bengal and Tamil nadu.





As soon as the Indentured Indian landed ashore he would be marched to estates and housed in slave barracks without mattresses or pillows. 





Life was dehumanizing, with no honour, little pay, poor diet, long toiling hours , insults , monetary fines and floggings with cattle whips at the slightest provocation. 




Cat of nine tails was used on deserters to bloody their backs and then rubbed with chillie and salt. Most of the time these "deserters" were the guys who objected to their pretty wives and sisters being taken away by the white man to his home for sex.




Death from Malaria, Typhoid, TB , Cholera , Beriberi, Hookworm etc took the toll. There was no clean water or latrines. They were unable even to bury or cremate the dead. In Grenada about 2000 sick Indians were kicked off the estate to die on the road side, nude ,skeleton ed and maggotted with even the parish missionaries turning the other way from these poor wailing souls . 




In Africa while building rail and roads they were eaten up by lions . After completing their 5 year contract they had to pay for their return fare. 

And with monetary fines for small offences, there was little money.





A new born child would be arbitrarily recorded as “ coolie” with name of father and mother also as “coolie “. If you go to South Africa , where there are currently about 1.2 million Indians--and look into the telephone directory there are more NAIDOOS than the Naidus in India. 




The grapevine is as follows — a ship lands up , the white immigration officer is drunk, hot and bothered seeing so many monkey look alikes . He says “ All of you fuc#ers are NAIDOOS — carry on!” . 





You will find hundreds of Indian names like Govender ( Govinda ), Moodley ( Murali ), Patiyachi ( beats me? ) in the telephone directory too.





Never in the history of mankind has there been a saga of such greed and injustice-- where more than 1.3 million innocent humans were duped whole sale , given a life sentence , dumped in far flung corners of the planet and forgotten for ever. 


Name of Colony        /  Number of Indian Indentured slaves

Mauritius             480,000
British Guiana      246,000
Trinidad               145,000
Jamaica                39,000

Others              47,000

Total               1,300,200





Today there are 3.1 million Indian origin people in the Caribbean alone. 





The majority of the Indians living in the English-speaking Caribbean came from eastern Uttar Pradesh and western Bihar, while those brought to Guadeloupe and Martinique were mostly from,  from Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. About twenty two percent of the indentured were Tamils and Telugus particularly in Trinidad and Tobago, and Guyana.




Yes -- SLAVERY REINVENTED by "man without a conscience" --John Gladstone and endorsed by the British crown.




Fabulously rich John Gladstone, (1763-1851) owned almost all the sugar plantations in Jamaica, and was the biggest slave trader .  He was the stooge of Opium runner and British East India company owner, German Jew R0thschild,  in British Parliament, where he was MP for 9 years. 





When slavery was abolished he was desperate to get Indentured labour from India, in his estates. The Indians lived in worse slave like conditions, and he would NOT even feed them properly. 





This evil and greedy man fooled the Indians by false promises. From 1838 to 1917, In British Guiana alone 260, 000 Indians were slaves. He bribed British Prime minister Sir Robert Peel, and made himself a Baronet in 1846. Then he bribed again using his Rothschild connection, and made sure his son , William Ewart Gladstone, was in politics in the cabinet of "good friend" Robert Peel, and in line to be future Prime Minister of UK. 






AN APOLOGY IS LONG OVERDUE.


I have interviewed lot of Telugu Indians aboard who were Indentured slaves- a lot of them in South Africa—the NAIDOOOS, the GOVENDERS , the PATIYAACHIS, the MOODLEYS  . I went to their homes and talked to their grandfathers.

Some remember as TERRIBLE GUNTUR FAMINE in 1832.   They said there was NO cholera or small pox—it was DELIBERATE famine created by the white invader to make them lose hope, convert them to indentured coolies..  

Most of the Guntur , Masulipatnam (Machilipatnam) Indians were farmers and weavers.  Masulipatnam was the the first trading settlement on the East coast of India established by Rothschild for his British East India Company. The famous Muslin cloth was created for the ancients Greeks at Masulie ( Maisolos ). 

60% of the people of Guntur area when the exodis started on British East India Company ships. Sir Walter Elliot writes that the famine of 1833 and the following epidemic had prostrated Guntur district and that "a man in perfect health was hardly to be seen anywhere".  

The superior Indian weaver’s cloth has no buyers in Manchester and Lancaster thanks to Rothschild controlled labour unions.

The Rothschild stooge President of the Blackburn Chamber of Commerce said that "the manufacturers of Lancashire should carefully watch the doings of the Indian manufactur­ers, they did try to place artificial obstacles in the way of development of this industry in India.


The legendary Guntur famine of 1832–1833 followed by DELIBERATE crop failure as well as excessive and uncertain levels of taxation on peasants.  The ruling British East India Company took no measures were adopted to formulate any general system of famine relief or prevention.


Nobody talks about the great DELIBERATE Orissa famine deliberately caused by Rothschild in 1866 / 67 where 5.8 million Indians died of starvation.





The Indian Vedic civilisation flourished from 9000 BC to 4000 BC on the banks of the river Saraswati, till the river dried up due to an earthquake blocking the glacial mouth at the Himalayas. In 9500 BC the white mans land had just come out from the Quaternary ice age. 











John Gladstone's exact words in the British Parliament was QUOTE "--  negroes yield to the ardent and uncontrolled influence of the fassions, where a promiscuous intercourse of the sexes takes place, there consequently fewer children are born ...so constant supply of negroes from Africa is requisite.--" UNQUOTE


NATHAN MAYER ROTHSCHILD NEEDED A SYSTEM WHERE DEAD SLAVES DO NOT HAVE TO BE REPLACED BY MORE SHIPMENTS OF SLAVES-- 



THEY NEEDED THEIR SLAVES TO REPRODUCE IN A PROFLIGATE MANNER, WHILE IN SLAVERY AND WHILE ON THE JOB.   HENCE THE JUMP FROM SLAVES TO " FERTILE INDIAN GENE INDENTURED LABOUR" --USING SLAVE TRADER JOHN GLADSTONE TO ARGUE THE CASE.  




IMAGINE A FAMOUS SLAVE TRADER JOHN GLADSTONE WAS MADE BARONET IN 1846, SUCH WAS THE MORALITY OF THE BRITISH QUEEN AND THE WORTH OF KNIGHTHOOD OF THE CROWN.




Below are pictures of slave trader Sir John Gladstone and his son William Gladstone, who was made Prime Minister







crossing over seven seas
promised a new land
how we have been crimped by them
and taken to Surinam

clothing, food, jewellery
all hope bound in togs
with the blessing of God Rama in our hands
depending on strangers on the water
with some regret and pain in the heart
may be better times will come now
after years of waiting
we too get some warmth of the sun

a few months together on the ship
mutual ties originate
the contract safely packed away
all kinds of thoughts appear
what kind of people will we meet in that land
will harvest be good
after five years of working hard and saving
I will return to my village

after such a long time in Surinam, brother
slowly one will get used to everything
now after having worked so hard
to leave everything behind and return
stay here says the heart
the state supports too with a piece of land
but in a corner of my heart
remains the dream of returning
to my village, one day

LET LOOSE THE DOGS OF WAR -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL





















WHO LET THE DOGS OUT — CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL

Whoever let the dogs out, pray like hell they are not Tibetan mastiffs. 

These powerful and highly spirited dogs , who CAN IGNORE PAIN , scare away leopards and packs of wolves. They can zig-zag corners with greater differential agility and grace than mountain leopards.

“ Let loose the dogs of war” is actually a true call given by the likes of Genghis Khan and Attila the Hun. 

They had hordes of tenacious and agile Tibetan mastiffs , each weighing more than 100 kilos with their armies. Their booming barks could be heard miles away, terrorising enemy horses. These dogs size up the situation before attacking, and can conserve energy.

There is no other animal on the planet of its like. 



Alexander the Great was presented with one and he took it with him back to Europe. By the way, Alexanders horse was never the same after being terrorised by an elephants roar during a battle in India. Queen Victoria was also presented with a huge one by the Indian Viceroy.



I once had a conversation with a shipping billionare. He boasted after a couple of drinks -- “ I have a yacht, airplane, Harley Davidson blah blah” . I asked him , “ Do you have a Tibetan mastiff ? “ -- and that pricked his bubble . He did not even know what it was.

Tibetan mastiffs are the most expensive dogs to own as a pet.  Prices for a trained dog, can go up to  1.8 million US dollars . These dogs have a penchant for cleanliness, like cats.



They have two spots on each inner eyebrow.



These dogs are found only in the Himalayas. They guard the Buddhist monasteries in Tibet. Lack of inter breeding has kept the race pure. 

The dogs are brave , fierce , loyal , elegant and have outstanding intelligence and stamina. Even if the noble and strong willed dog is deliberately kept starved it will not attack the livestock of its master. 



At night it loves to bark as is programmed in its DNA, but the moment you take it indoors it stops barking. It has a kind expression as is seen in the picture—notice the mane and the huge bear like head.

Its booming bark contains the mysterious INFRASOUND that freezes blood ( cortisol release affecting neuro transmitters ) due to fear.  Even mountain leopards run away.

As soon as Chanakya came to know that Alexander the great had crossed the Dardenelles with his Greek army, he resigned from Taxila University. He mentored a handpicked student Chandra Gupta Maurya .  Kingmaker Chanakya got him crowned Emperor of a new formed Maurya empire. 

This united kingdom empire was waiting for the Greek invader .  Even before Alexander fought King Porus, his frightened army horses were mentally disintegrated just by the barks of a horde of Tibetan Mastiffs collected by Chanakya .



It is difficult to train this dog as it is aloof and does not like being bossed around. However it is very eager to please its master and people it knows. 

The opposite holds good with strangers, it will not trust them or eat food if offered.



No wonder this dog has tremendous awe value and holds the respect of all.




Grace and peace!

THE RAPE OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL








THE RAPE OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS – -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL

Arnold Swartznegger was given a truth serum in the Hollywood movie “ True Lies “. 

All of a sudden it became fashionable to use truth serum to force criminal suspects to tell the truth..

Recently I saw the method of using narcoanalysis (Sodium Pentothal) on the so called killers of a school girl by the name of Aarushi Talwar, on a Indian national TV channel.

Note:- I am a bit of a body language expert.   I do NOT see any real embedded grief in her own parents -- whose flesh and blood she is.  Where is the catch?

I hasten to say, I found the method of interrogation 100% wrong. I was surprised that no experts objected, during the subsequent days . 

These interrogators had no dang idea how the human subconscious works. During narcoanalysis , you must NOT suggest to the patient, like a hypnotist. The patient may own up for a murder he has never done. Hypnosis is a whole different ball game.

No justice was being done to the poor men ( scape goats actually ) being interrogated, who were getting slapped regularly to prevent them from falling asleep.

Subconscious mind responds to stimuli not pressure. A truth serum must not be used to weaken the resolve of the subject and make him more compliant to pressure. 

It is a crime to RAPE the subconscious mind , by ignorant misuse of truth serum sodium pentathol . 

By injecting a truth serum a subject's delusions, fears and fantasies cannot be distinguished from reality. People would even confess to crimes that they clearly did not commit, perhaps the murder of a non-existent mistress or rape of his neighbour. 

Brain is not capable of distinguishing between reality and memory—the same neurons are sparked when we see something as when we merely remember it. 



Brain cannot distinguish between an image of experience and one of vivid imagination. You can participate in an orgy or think of an orgy, your wee willie winkie will give the same standing ovation.

This drug, Sodium Pentothal is usually used in medicine as sedatives. It acts as a depressant on the central nervous system and bring on a state of complete relaxation and a feeling of well-being. It just makes you chatty, as inhibitions are lost.. 

So all that a "truth serum" will do is probably loosen a person's tongue when you're very suggestible during the sedative, or relaxed, stage of anaesthesia. But there's absolutely no guarantee of truth. 

The reality is that you stay in this stage for only a very short time - so you have to be continually "topped up" with more drugs. This can involve many injections ( probably half a dozen) over a period of 2 - 8 hours. Sometimes with improper dose , the subject does not increase truth-telling, but merely increases talking; hence, both truth and bull will be revealed in that construct. The patient may lose the inhibition, but may not lose his self-control. . There is no drug that will relax a person's defences so that they will happily and reliably reveal the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

The only 100% reliable way is to falsely give the subject the tendency to believe that he has revealed more than they actually did, and then make him confess the next day , at a time when his system is totally free of this drug— basically a form of trickery.

If you were to drink a glass of water with Sodium Pentothal, it would depress your central nervous system, slow your heart rate and lower your blood pressure. All of the listed above affects are the functions of any commonplace sedative.

When a person is in coma , anastesia, narco serum, shock, seizure or sleeping—the subconscious minds are wide open. Anything that will be said in their presence will be accepted by the spirit which will begin carrying it out. 

Any passing comment or trivial statements can have a devastating effect on our subconscious mind because it is not argumentative or analytical. It accepts all statements directly on the face value. Even prayers and beliefs are positive signals which we give to our subconscious mind as something acceptable and true.

The subconscious mind cannot tell the difference between a real experience and one that you vividly imagine. You can fool it.


It is necessary to understand how the subconscious works. The subconscious mind does not think—it is only a store house of our experience. It has no sense of time. It cannot differentiate between positive and negative input. It cannot tell the difference between real and imagines experience.

The conscious mind can be engaged 100% in talking or deep thinking while the subconscious keeps the car on the road. The conscious and subconscious minds are connected through a filter. So we cant read the contents of our subconscious mind

###########

Conscious = induction+ deduction ( determines what is to be done ). LEFT BRAIN LOBE : Numbers, written language, reasoning, spoken language, scientific skills , RH control

Subconscious = only deduction ( no thinking , draws conclusions, does not care for right or wrong, gives the power to do the job ) RIGHT BRAIN LOBE ( for right handers ): Insight, 3D forms , art, imagination, music, left hand control

############



Subconscious, mental activities within an individual proceed without his awareness. Dreams and slips of the tongue are concealed examples of unconscious content too threatening to be confronted directly. 

When the situation demands we are able to use the subconscious memory to the full extent—but only in relation to the specific problem. The conscious mind has limited memory. The subconscious mind has unlimited memory.

Subconscious mind never sleeps even in a coma. the Subconscious has a tendency to accept what it imagines as real. 

Every experience we have ever had is impressed somewhere in the electrochemical cells in our brain. The brain records every thing—every thing senses by our 5 senses—and it is imprinted in the brain cells for ever. Whenever something reactivates those cells we get a mental picture duplicating the original experience.

The central nervous system does not know the difference between visualization and the event. Visualizing you are having sex and doing the real thing has the same effect. The picture in our mind has an impact on every cell in our bodies. Thinking is not an action of the mind , but an action of our entire body. Tell your subconscious what you want repeatedly and it will produce it. You can call this visualization or intention. 

The subconscious has a perfect memory. Every thing you have experienced using your 5 senses is part of the permanent memory of the subconscious mind, which never sleeps The subconscious mind acts on old beliefs stored over a lifetime. Many of those beliefs you may have accepted without thinking. Or you may have absorbed them when you were too young to exercise choice.

Hypnosis is state wherein your conscious (thinking) mind becomes bored … it relaxes and stops thinking Persons who can do self hypnosis has discovered the secret of successful living. All hypnosis is self hypnosis.—no one can hypnotise you against your will. There is no loss of consciousness in hypnosis. 


Hypnosis is an altered state of consciousness, during which the conscious critical mind is relaxed and relatively inactive, and the doorway to the subconscious, inner mind is opened with a person’s permission. A hypnotist talks directly to the subconscious mind, without interference from reasoning . Truth serums are also used in psychiatry to help patients speak more freely during psychoanalysis because they help the patient release many thoughts locked in the subconscious.

The subconscious mind is protective. Hypnotized people will accept suggestions that are acceptable, and reject suggestions that are not acceptable. a person is in Hypnosis, he is not asleep. He or she is very much aware of all that is going on. In actuality, in Hypnosis, one’s senses become heightened and more acute. 

Hypnosis is not a truth serum. Subjects in Hypnosis reveal no secrets in the Hypnotic State that they would not reveal (because they want to) in the Waking State. Hypnosis is a cooperative and collaborative relationship. The subject retains full control and responsibility for his or her actions at all times. 

The hypnotized subject or patient is NOT asleep. He is relaxed, comfortable, focused, and in a state of daydream type thinking. His analyzing thinking mind (Conscious mind) is turned off and his feeling and intuitive and creative mind (Subconscious) is aware of everything that is going on. 

A hypnotized subject cannot be made to do anything he is not willing to do. If a person is not willing to cooperate, he cannot be hypnotized. Hypnosis is NOT about the hypnotist controlling the patient. It is about the patient gaining more control over himself. 

By following the "hypnotist's" instructions, you become more suggestible. When you are in this altered state of increased suggestibility, your mental "clutter" is cleared away so that you can pay attention to the hypnotist's suggestions and be open to experiencing new perspectives and solutions to your problem. 

Once the Hypnotic State is induced and the doorway to the Subconscious Mind is opened, with your permission, the competent Hypnotist can provide information, in a language and form that the Subconscious can accept, to help you change the behaviors, feelings and thoughts that you want to change. We utilize the fact that the Subconscious Mind has the ability (actually the tendency) to accept what it imagines as real. 

Some people can go into hypnosis while riding a stationary bicycle ( repetitive ). , if a hypnotherapist`s suggestion conflicts with a client's value system, the client simply brings him or herself up out of hypnosis; they just "wake up." a person cannot be hypnotized to do anything not in line with their moral and value system. 

Olympic teams have Hypnotists to facilitate top performances from its athletes. A hypnotic stage is not mysterious. You actually enter and exit this state of mind many times during a ordinary day. Something triggers this state.

Subconscious mind has a memory of 100 trillion images, all our experiences, emotions and feelings are stored as an image or a sound in a digitised manner . Data that cannot be recalled are retained in the subconscious. A person may be unconscious of ever having been locked in a closet as a child, yet under hypnosis he may recall the experience vividly.

Negative suggestions with growing children gets rooted in their subconscious mind and is reflected later in their behavior. 

During hypnosis –our conscious mind goes into a trance and suggestions are given directly to the subconscious mind, which cannot argue but accepts the suggestion at its face value.

We do self hypnosis unknowingly several times an a day while doing our day to day activities. This is how our body learns to relax otherwise we would die of stress at a very early age. Any monotonous sequence of events make it boring for the brain and eventually it starts producing a hormone called Serotin which induces a drowsy state of mind. 

On my ship if have seen the POWERS OF VODKA as a truth serum especially in conjunction with suitable music and blue light for the alpha state , that can open pathways to the subconscious.

RADHA BINOD PAL, THE FORGOTTEN INDIAN-- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL
























RADHA BINOD PAL – VICTORS JUSTICE-- WAR CRIME TRIBUNAL-  HIDEKI TOJO HAIKU- HIROSHIMA NAGASAKI 

A few years ago I stayed in Japan for a month to take delivery of a new ship , from the yard. 

During one of the official dinners , the boss of the yard asked me if I knew PERRUYYA. I was taken aback a bit, still I said yes.

And then the man shed a few tears , and then continued on and on about Perruya— what a great hero he is for the Japanese people, and how his shrine at Chiyoda Tokyo is a place of worhip. 

My puzzled Canadian Chief Engineer asked me, “ Who the hell is this guy? “. 

I said “ He means Pal Lawyer!, I’ll tell you later, about him ” 

My chief engineer whispered into my ear “ How can Perruyya be Pal Lawyer? “ . 

I said “ When one of my officers Japanese girl friends got upset with my second officer for ditching her , she had barged into the officers lounge and shouted “ I don’t rrike you, I don’t rrove you, you are butter frry, you are prray boy, you are ARRU FUCKIN’ BARRU “ . This could only have meant - “ You are a butterfly, you are a playboy , you are all balls !” 

--considering Japs can’t pronounce L , like how the Chinks can’t pronounce R.

In Rabaul ( Papua New Guinea ) I have seen from my cabin port hole , Japanese tourists lying face down on the mud on top of one of the World war 11 Japanese warship wrecks – I knew how emotional they could get over their dead ancestors.

Radha Binod Pal (27 January 1886 – 10 January 1967) was just one of the 11 jurists of the International military tribunal set up after the 2nd word war, known as Tokyo trials, to punish the Japanese . 

Only one person was a career judge – the ex-professor of Law at Calcutta University, Justice Radhabinod Pal. The rest, mostly British, American and Australian were either ex-army officers or diplomats. Except for Judge Radhabinod Pal, no one had any legal training, formal or informal. No wonder Pal was the most eloquent and informed man on the bench in matters of international law . 

Pal was expected to toe the line of his white ex-masters. However Pal had the courage to stand by his convictions. He refused to let Allied political concerns and purposes, let alone the charter, influence his judgment in any way . While clearly acknowledging the fact that the Japanese were indeed guilty of horrendous war crimes, he argued that the Allies who were judging them were also guilty of the same. 

Indeed he questioned the very legitimacy of the Military Tribunal, and argued that it was driven solely by the spirit of retribution rather than international law. According to his view, the trial was the judgment of the vanquished by the victors; such proceedings, even if clothed in the garb of law, resulted in nothing but the satisfaction of the desire for vengeance. 

In his lone dissent, he refers to the trial as a "sham employment of legal process for the satisfaction of a thirst for revenge." His very detailed document of dissent was promptly banned from publication, for many years. His judgement that the Allies were also equally guilty of war crimes, and that victors justice cannot be endorsed , was not palatable , at all. 

He brought in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in his judgment as atrocities comparable with Nazi crimes. No wonder Justice Radhabinod Pal has the status of a national hero in Japan. 

A memorial in his honor is prominent in the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo. 

In 1966, the Emperor of Japan conferred upon Pal the First Class of the Order of the Sacred Treasure when he visited Japan. He remarked that he had admired Japan from a young age for being the only Asian nation that "stood up against the West."

When Japanese Prime minister Shinzo Abe visited India ,in August 2007 he remember how Pal had saved his grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, guilty of war crimes, and the Japanese Emperor, from the gallows. (Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo , who sanctioned the attack on Pearl Harbour, was however hanged . Hideki Tojo left a haiku written in Pal's honour before going to the gallows) . 

Pal would bow to the Japanese benches every time he entered the court, irritating all. This was despite , that the number of Indian combatants killed in World War II exceeded the numbers of those of most of the other countries directly involved.  And Indians soldiers of Subash Chandra Bose's INA were tricked into digging 650 kilometers of tunnels in Rabaul-- a task worse than death itself.  And all of them were eaten for food--except for a few who escaped into the dense jungles..

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with Pal's son, Prasanta, in Kolkata . They chatted for half an hour at a city hotel.

Pal is also worshipped at the Kao Kannon temple at Atami. The ashes of Hideki Tojo is preserved here.

THE VEDIC QUANTUM INTENTION EXPERIMENT-- COCONUT BREAKING-- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL













COCONUT BREAKING -- THE VEDIC QUANTUM INTENTION EXPERIMENT— CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL

Since past 11000 years Hindu vedic rituals require breaking of the coconut at Yagnas. It is form of bloodless sacrifice. The liquid spilt is electrolytic plasma.


The vedic civilisation flourished from 9000 BC to 4000 BC on the banks of the river Saraswati, till the river dried up due to an earthquake blocking the glacial mouth at the Himalayas. These seers had 12 strand DNA and king sized resonating pineal glands.





In quantum physics terms -- it causes a " butterfly effect " .





It is all about HUMAN INTENTION, COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS, SCALAR WAVES and ZERO POINT FIELD. 



Potential is only manifested when we provide the frequency information through our intentions— concept of MIND OVER MATTER.


For the uninitiated –it is just a pure offering to god. Rather the purest as faster than light, NEUTRINOS don't pass through it. 





There is nothing on this planet purer or more sterile than tender coconut water. The water has a divine quality as it contains lauric acid found in mothers milk and is also identical to human plasma. 


Because of its capacity to dissolve numerous substances in large amounts, pure water rarely occurs in nature.


There are three eyes on top of the coconut shell. Only piercing the middle one will allow you to access the water inside. This middle eye is referred to as Shiva’s third eye. Rather its is the mediator( sattva ) of yin- yang or tamas -rajas.





The water is an electrolyte and boosts circulation and is anti bacterial. 


While breaking the coconut the devotee must INTEND as per the vedic traditions. This is to tune our self to the quantum level energy matrix, this energy is transferred to our DNA.


Human intention can create quantum fluctuations in the ZERO POINT FIELD , a vast unharnessed energy source . We resonate in Zero Point Energy —human intention can influence the universe. 


Nikola Tesla was introduced to this ocean of energy --Akasha ( Ether ) by The Hindu great master Swami Vivekananda. He told Tesla that the "emptiness" of empty space is in fact not empty, but a great ocean of seething energy! This included the empty space within the atom in which electrons zoomed around. Akasha is the womb of creation bringing forth every physical aspect that can be perceived with the senses according to Hindu traditions.





Consciousness, is a form of EM energy, that focused thought (with intent) can achieve extraordinary things


A beam of coherent intention is split into two—past and future. They meet in the present moment of NOW in the holographic universe.





 Holograms are three-dimensional pictures placed on a two-dimensional surface, which gives the image a curvature when the observer moves. 








Our brain stores information in a holographic form. Each cell in our body carries all the information's needed to produce a copy. 


Your intention ( basically an impulse ) is a powerful activator of your internal pharmacy. “Deliver us from evil” is the usual intention. Each individual mind has access to the universal mind. Human perception occurs because of interactions between the subatomic particles of our brains an the quantum energy sea. We literally resonate the Cosmos.


The quantum field or pure consciousness is influenced by intention. 





SCALAR WAVES CAN BE REGARDED AS ELECTROMAGNETIC SOUND WAVES-- BEING LONGITUDINAL, AND NOT TRANSVERSE. Scalar waves from your mobius supercoil DNA couples with intention and consciousness. Intentions enhance the body’s natural flow of scalar energy produced by DNA. Your DNA can send and receive powerful data through the universal network of ether.. 


Scalar waves are created by a pair of identical waves (usually called the wave and its anti wave) that are in phase spatially, but out of phase temporally. The two waves are physically identical, but 180 degrees out of phase in terms of time. Scalar waves are different from normal hertzian waves– like an infinitely projected mobius pattern on axis, and are more field like than wave like.


Scalar waves can be created by wrapping electrical wires around a figure eight in the shape of a möbius coil. When an electric current flows through the wires in opposite directions, the opposing electromagnetic fields from the two wires cancel each other and create a scalar wave. Have a a look at the pictures of the FIGURE OF EIGHT mobius coils in your 8 strand DNA ( with evolution it will become 12 strand, like for Indigo children ) . The möbius coil intersection occurs just in front of the lungs, which contain a huge web-like network of capillary connections. This capillary network acts as a battery for the storage of scalar waves.





DNA can send and receive powerful data through the universal network of ether.. In the quantum holographic DNA-wave biocomputer theory, DNA is a self-calibrating antenna working by phase conjugate ( scalar waves and phase conjugation) adaptive resonance , capable of both receiving and transmitting quantum holographic information , stored in the form of diffraction patterns-quantum holograms. 





Zero Point Field is an information field as it encodes everything that has left its traces in the form of Scalar waves in this universe. This boils down to the recording of every little thought that was ever thought and every little move that was ever made. The interference patterns of the scalar waves form a huge hologram that permeates the whole of the universe.


Intention is like the tuning fork which causes other forks to resonate to the same frequency.








Chromosomes that are damaged by X-rays, for instance, can be repaired by simply applying vibration and language, or sound combined with intention, or words or Mantra, to DNA!. When properly activated by sound combined with intention, the superconductor that is DNA is designed to re-harmonize the entire bioenergy blueprint.


The seemingly magical operations of psychoenergetics, sometimes called "psychotronics," cannot be achieved with ordinary transverse EM wave energy. But they are possible with longitudinal scalar waves because the mind itself is scalar in nature


We cannot observe the quantum world using our limited five senses. Instead we must imagine particles as they really are-- structures of matter waves (like quantum waves) in their wave medium, the quantum ether. 


Our intentions create our reality. As proved amply by the double slit experiment the consciousness of the observer brought the observed object into being. 






Nothing in the universe existed as an actual thing independently of our perception of it.


Mind and matter are both made of the same basic stuff. The difference has to be found in the composition of vibration or ripples. Matter belongs to larger and slower waves, which implies that it possesses less energy of the absolute. Mind is made out of much finer ripples, which indicate that it contains more of the consciousness of the absolute.


Scalar waves allow for information transfer across the universe, connecting every atom with every other atom and since these waves travel at super luminous speeds they could be the explanation of the non-local effects that were predicted in theory and empirically discovered in quantum physics.


Our universe is NOT a bunch of single individual parts of atoms, molecules, planets and stars that only maintain contact by separate forces such as gravity acting upon them. Quantum entangled particles keep their coherent relation eternally and are not bothered by any distance separating them whether it be a few millimetres or the distance of a galaxy.





Scalar waves are information carrying waves rather than energy waves. which are linked to human consciousness and are created by human thought and emotions. They are the interface between the mental and the physical world although we must keep in mind that in reality there is no duality between them. Scalar waves encode the information of space and time into a timeless spaceless quantum shorthand of interference patterns. 


Little did Darwin know , that Biology is a quantum DNA process. All the processes in the body including cell communications are triggered by quantum fluctuations, and all higher brain functions and consciousness also appears at the quantum level. Newtons modern physics has set mankind back by many centuries. 



In ignoring the effect of ZPF he had eliminated the possibility of interconnectedness and obscured a scientific explanation for many kinds of miracles. Psychic remote viewers see information encoded in quantum fluctuation. They pick this right out of the field. The US and Soviet armies have their own psychic spying wing.






On Makara Sankranti , at the Sabarimala temple in Kerala, India - FIVE MILLION minds having the same thought, format and intent, break coconuts.





 There exists a coherence in the "many-minds to the detecting charges" of the universe -- at least in that volume of space with a radius equal to the speed of light multiplied by the time since they all gained that coherence. Collective consciousness is a life force flowing through the universe. Remember, our wishes and our intentions create our reality.





WHEN YOU BREAK THE COCONUT YOU MUST SHUT OFF YOUR INTERNAL MIND-MONKEY CHATTER, BE IN THE MOMENT FOR THE BRIEF ALPHA STATE WITHOUT EGO , MAKE YOUR " INTENTION" RING THE TUNING FORK OF YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS -- TO RESONATE TO THE QUANTUM LEVEL ENERGY MATRIX -- AS A VORTEX OF GROUP COHERENT MEMORY.





-- AND UNLEASH THE SCALAR WAVES AT THE SPEED OF THOUGHT , LIKE A TSUNAMI -- NAY --SOLITON-- INTO THE FABRIC OF SPACE TIME , TO DO ITS OWN MIRACLE.





If the coconut does not break into two even halves -- it is a divine indication that what you intend may not succeed.


Tesla Coil only uses sine waves or harmonic waves and quantum chaos already acknowledges that the sine wave creates a “hidden coherence” that bends space time. The sine wave is the secret behind current faster-than-light quantum electronics. The soliton is the quantum chaos sine wave that achieves anti gravity.





The speed of light (communication), or electron to electron reaction, is slower than the speed of gravity, or quark to quark reaction--hence the higher the scalar wave frequency, the faster the time rate.


Next time you visit a doctor , pl be aware that the Intention of doctor is as important as the medicine he gives you. 


When a new Indian ship is launched , a coconut is broken on the ships bow, with an intention that the ship and the sailors who man her, must be safe till she goes for scrap.. This idea has been lifted and the rest of the world breaks a champagne bottle.

Author Lynn McTaggart, has written a book " The intention experiment".  There is NOT a single original idea in the entire book.  Yet she had NOT made a single mention of Vedas or India." 






World war 3 , will be all about engineering the collective conscious by scalar interferometry -- the ultimate quantum psychotronic weapon.

PINEAL GLAND -- THE THIRD EYE-- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL














PINOLINE GENERATOR -- THE PINEAL GLAND-- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL

The THIRD EYE of Lord Shiva is in reality is the Pineal Gland. This super conducting resonator has mystical powers. Once the third eye is developed it is far more powerful than any of your 5 human senses. 

Though it is not part of the brain, the pineal gland develops from the roof of the diencephalon, a section of the brain, and functions as a light receptor. Darwin may not agree with me -- but, the pineal gland is the evolutionary forerunner of the modern eye. . This gland synthesizes melatonin and enzymes sensitive to diurnal light. Rhythmic changes in its activity in response to cyclical photic input shows that the gland serves as a biological clock. 

To activate the 'third eye' and perceive higher dimensions, the pineal ( soul ) and the pituitary ( body ) glands must vibrate in YIN-YANG unison, to create a field , which is achieved through meditation, Mantra chanting ( cymatics )and Surya yog ( sun gazing.) 



The great Himalayan masters did surya yog by gazing at the rising sun with a silver coin placed in between the eyebrows on the forehead .

The solar wind at dawn, charging the earth’s magnetic field, stimulates the pineal gland. This is the best time to meditate , chant and sun gaze. At dawn, the negatively charged pineal and the positively charged pituitary combine their essences to create a "light in the head". 



Pranayama floods the Pineal gland with oxygen, to make it resonate. If you are right handed you must breathe in via the left nostril.

The ancient Indian mystics have used the hallucinogenic effects of Soma of Rig Veda ( more potent than LSD ) to induce this effect. 114 hymns of the 7000 year old Rig Veda talks about Soma preparations and its effects. 



This is the elusive HOLY GRAIL for telepathy and psychic teleportation -- not what Dan Brown wrote in the Da Vinci code.



Many achievers have used this dark Vedic secret. I cant reveal all the names. However i can say Leonardo Da Vinci , the great visionary was one of them. ( Nostradamus,the oracles of Delphi etc ). The psychedelic journeys are accessed and experienced within the realms of the pineal gland. Serotonin has the same chemical structure as this hallucinogenic substance.

As per quantum laws we are essentially electrical beings existing in a state of resonance with the electromagnetic field of the earth. 


The reddish grey pineal gland is located in the geometric center of the brain. It is located directly behind the eyes.

There are many who think that Pineal Gland is the only organ of the brain that does not come inpairs. However, under a microscope you can see that the pineal gland is divided into two fine hemispheres.

The nerves that serve the pineal gland don't originate in the brain but in the sympathetic nervous system. In adults, calcium make the pineal gland visible on X rays.

In Vedic times 10000 years ago, at the banks of the Sraswati river, the crystallised pineal gland of the great Masters was said to be the size of a lemon, and this with evolution, spiritual pollution and change in breathing patterns , has now been atrophied to the size of a small ground nut.

In Mahabharata war of 4000 BC, Sanjaya , with awakened Kundalini and 12 DNA strands , sits 5000 kms from the scene of battle and gives the blind King Dhritarashtra a blow by blow account.



This gland can be activated by activated by sunlight, and also by sound resonance. It controls the various biorhythms of the body. It can discern negative energies, based on perception of vibrating energies around you.

It plays a major role in hibernation of animals, metabolism, and seasonal breeding. In humans it affects circadian rhythms, sleep patterns ( melatonin levels increase at night), and is implicated in seasonal affective disorder.


The pineal gland calcifies with age and melatonin production correspondingly decreases. 

Serotonin is transformed into melatonin only in the pineal gland. Decline in melatonin is the trigger for the aging process, for Melatonin is the SUPER ANTIOXIDANT of nature. The hormone Melatonin, induces sleep, while Serotonin, keeps you happy and in a balanced mental state of mind. PROZAC raises serotonin. 

When the pineal gland does not receive sunlight, it secretes Melatonin, which induces sleep, increases blood sugar, craze for food, leading to obesity, fears and anxiety.

The pineal gland is a photosensitive organ and thus an important timekeeper for the human body.

For migrating birds, the pineal gland is the center for navigation. The pineal gland is a magneto receptor, capable of monitoring magnetic fields, and helping to align the body in space. Changing the direction of magnetic fields around the heads of birds alters their ability to orient. The pineal can generate its own magnetic field because it contains magnetite. This field can interact with the earth's magnetic field.



Electromagnetic fields (EMF) suppress the activity of the pineal gland and reduce melatonin production. EMF activity therefore disrupts the bodies circadian rhythms. Cell phones, with their dangerous radiation fields, attack the pineal gland .

The pineal gland produces PINOLINE, ( 6-methoxy-tetra-dydro-beta carboline, or 6-MeO-THBC). Pinoline also resonates with the very pulse of life 7.83 Hertz, the pulse the DNA uses to replicate, and which has been measured to be emitted from the brains and hands of all successful healers, regardless of belief or faith.



Flouride is a free radical scavenger and a antioxidant like melatonin . Being in the chemical field i can say for sure , it is a VERY DANGEROUS FOR YOUR PINEAL GLAND. It has an affinity to deposit on tissues rich in calcium . I have seen in Southern USA , people drink excessive iced green tea having high levels of flouride -- and are NOT TOO BRIGHT. 


Fluorine is one of the major ingredients in the controversial psycho-active psychiatric drug PROZAC (Fluoxetene Hydrochloride), and also in deadly Sarin military nerve gas.

Flouride is slightly less poisonous than Arsenic. White phosphoric acid is used in Coke, and does NOT corrode ship's stainless steel tanks. But if it has little bit of Flouride contaminant , it is used for fertilisers and it corrodes the ships stainless steel tank. Boiling water removes Chlorine, but concentrates Flouride. It can be removed only by reverse osmosis and NOT by ordinary filters. 

Fluorine is not found by itself in nature, because it is so unstable that it chemically combines--violently, in many cases--with practically any other element. Fluorine has a natural affinity for calcium. Sodium fluoride, is a common ingredient in rat and cockroach poisons. Sodium fluoride rat poison rapidly alters the calcium metabolism of the body, rapidly destroys enzyme activity, and severely interferes with functions of the nerve channels.

Resonance can vibrate the pineal gland, to release seratonin, melatonin, DMT, etc. If you have a strong enough sense of conciousness you will taste a huge pituitary release in the back of your mouth and sinuses and throat, it is referred to as ambrosia ( amrit -- mental orgasm discharge ) . This is a result of DMT production . DMT is the spirit molecule that bends space-time.



Crystals amplifies the radio wave field by resonating or vibrating in oneness with the source of the radio signal . When you move the dial on the radio to tune into a favorite station, you are arriving at the perfect resonance between its electronic circuit and the station's frequencies. 

When two vibrating systems are in resonance with each other, a rise in amplitude in the waves takes place. 

The planet and the cosmos communicates with us in this primal language of frequencies.

The sacred hyperdimensional geometry of DMT via hadronic mechanics is the Sri Yantra -- the universal phase-conjugational force . Pineal DMT is the chemical messenger which links body and spirit. Pinoline enables the threshold levels of DMT to become active in the brain, but it requires an instant bungee jump induced adrenaline burst. DMT with Pinoline increases brain activation multi fold.

Pineal activation awakens normally latent neural pathways. Nerve fibers leave the pineal and make synaptic connections with other brain sites through traditional nerve-to-nerve connections, not just through endocrine secretions.

There is a lot we knew 10000 years ago , but has been lost to this this 21st century-- right? You cant observe the quantum world without your Pineal gland -- the other 5 senses have too narrow bandwidths. 

Quantum physics has showed the ancient Indian Yogis were NOT mere dreamers of cosmic consciousness, where our bodies, our brain and its mind, as inextricably joined with other matter and the mega dipole of universe . 


There is indeed a connection between consciousness and tangled state quantum phenomena. 

The third world war will be won by Scalar Psychotronics or mass mind control-- when in big brother will have you in a vice grip by your PG ( pineal gland ), not by your SC ( short curlies ).



Newtonian science requires OBJECTIVE proof verifiable by 5 human senses. Little did he know that these 5 bands are too narrow-- rest being squelched to prevent man from breaking down.

Western medicine treats man like a machine--looking for symptoms and a piece meal cure..

Newton backed Descartes in assuming that body and mind are two separate entities. Quantum physics have told the duo who had blinkers on for the macroscopic world, where to get off. 

Quantum physics is based on the power of observation, and the mind is factored in. 

Tesla, Einstein, Heisenberg, Shrodinger etc were all familiar with the Indian Vedanta, which had known " wave-particle duality" and " power of human intention " 10000 years ago-- where the invisible outside the narrow band of 5 human senses , is part of reality .




EASTERN VEDIC RISHIS MYSTICS HAD THE ABILITY TO GO ON EITHER SIDE OF THE NARROW BAND OF 5 HUMAN SENSES, WITH A KING SIZED RESONATING PINEAL GLAND. THEY COULD TRANSCEND THE SENSES AND LIMITATION OF SPACE-TIME. 


They firmly believed that the invisible below the quantum screen gives rise to the visible. Consciousness is about being self aware through observation ( double slit experiment ) and inner experience.

While Newton tries to explain the invisible through the visible. There is no room for consciousness or morphogenetic fields in the dictionary of Darwin. 



Buddha who had a king sized Pineal gland himself-- said in the first verse of Dharmapada--

" We are what we think
All what we are arises from our thoughts 
With our thoughts we make the world." 




Opposing forces Tamas and Rajas are connected through consciousness ( yin-yang ).  The middle prong of Shiva’s trident is Sattwa. It is about quantum possibility vortex vibrations, between two poles.. Together they express the great void at absolute peace with itself. To activate the third eye of Shiva, or to perceive higher dimensions, the pineal gland ( soul ) and the pituitary glands ( body ) must vibrate in resonance to create a field. This is represented by Samudra manthan in Hindu mythology, where mount meru is used to churn the oceans for Amrit or Ambrosia in a to and fro movement , representing vibrations.. The amrit of the ambrosia or Soma is the holy grail.  This is what the Templar knights got after excavating King Solomon's temple. Soma is a divine LSD-- rather a million times more powerful DMT. A 12 strand Maharishi with NIL junk DNA can produce it naturally, by resonating his pineal gland with his DNA, and achieve telepathy and psychic teleportation. The psychedelic journeys are accessed and experienced within the realms of the pineal gland. The pineal gland is the Shiva lingam. Serotonin has the same chemical structure as this hallucinogenic substance Soma. Serotonin is transformed into melatonin only in the pineal gland. Decline in melatonin is the trigger for the aging process, for Melatonin is the super-oxidant of nature. The hormone Melatonin, induces sleep, while Serotonin, keeps you happy and in a balanced mental state of mind. PROZAC raises serotonin. The pineal gland produces Pinoline, ( 6-methoxy-tetra-dydro-beta carboline, or 6-MeO-THBC ) . Pinoline also resonates with the very pulse of life 7.83 Hertz, the pulse the DNA uses to replicate, and which has been measured to be emitted from the brains and hands of all successful healers, regardless of belief or faith. OM king mantra is 7.843 hertz. Resonance can vibrate the pineal gland, to release Nuerotransmitter seratonin, melatonin, DMT, etc.  If you have a strong enough sense of consciousness you will taste a huge pituitary release in the back of your mouth and sinuses and throat, it is referred to as ambrosia ( amrit -- mental orgasm discharge ) . This is a result of DMT production . DMT is the spirit molecule that bends space-time. Pineal DMT is the chemical messenger which links body and spirit. Dimethyltryptamine, a psychedelic tryptamine Pinoline enables the threshold levels of DMT to become active in the brain, but it requires an instant bungee jump induced adrenaline burst.  DMT with Pinoline increases brain activation multi fold. You cant observe the quantum world without your Pineal gland -- the other 5 senses have too narrow bandwidths. Quantum physics has showed the ancient Indian Yogis were NOT mere dreamers of cosmic consciousness, where our bodies, our brain and its mind, as inextricably joined with other matter and the mega dipole of universe . There is indeed a connection between consciousness and tangled state quantum phenomena Indian Vedic maharishis had the inherent ability to go on either side of the narrow band of five human senses. THEY COULD TRANSCEND THE SENSES AND LIMITATION OF SPACE-TIME. They firmly believed that the invisible below the quantum screen gives rise to the visible. At the time of death Seratonin and Melatonin in the brain breaks down to Dimethyltryptamine or DMT, C12 N2 H16, just after the oxygen stops circulating. This is the moment for the ultimate DMT trip. You see your whole past life as FRACTAL dvine geometry. When you consume Soma, colours , sounds and numbers all show up as fractal geometry. What you have learnt in the past is of no use to you. As you breathe in the oxygen enters your brain and causes an explosion of fractal colours. To the spiritual eastern mind, the story of SAMUDRA MANTHAN produces amazing acts of faith like the Kumbh Mela , which has been going on for 6000 years. Tamas and Rajas are conscious of each other. Amrit reveals the fractal nature of consciousness. Amrit is NOT external, it is produced inside your head.  All you need to know is how to produce it by your own mind. 12 strand DNA which ancient Maharishis had, has now degraded to 2 strand DNA. These 12 strand DNA maharishis with raised Kundalinis , can read akashik records , convert them from fractal geometry, for daily life use. The cobra on Lord Shiva 's shoulders shows raised Kundalini and open third eye. This self realisation (of opening the third eye) , is the ultimate goal of consciousness. The timeless spiritual wisdom of the of the 7000 year old Vedas will roar to life after Dec 21st 2012- the veil of Maya or delusion over the third eye will be ripped asunder—as the first step towards upgrading the 2 strand 97% junk DNA to 12 strand nil junk DNA.. -- Capt Ajit Vadakayil

THE SUPER GENIUS WITH OCCULT STATUS -- THE TRUE MARTYR -- NIKOLA TESLA -- BY CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL












On July 10th 2009, GOOGLE declared that they would promote July 10th ( birthday of super genius Tesla ) as a SCIENCE and BROTHERHOOD DAY. I had blogged on 5th July 2009, hoping this would happen. 




               
Have a look at the attached satellite picture of the world at night-- all the lights are lit by ALTERNATING CURRENT invented by Tesla. 

               
There is only ONE martyr to science and human progress--- the only scientist with a shining legacy.. One full generation ignored his outstanding achievements , yet Tesla refused to expose cheaters and ignored his patent infringers till he died. 

                 
I started blogging to re-introduce Tesla to the young world. I started wearing TESLA CLUB emblazoned T shirts. 

People would ask me -- "Who is Tesla?". When i reply that he is the guy who invented AC electricity -- each of them would say " But is was Edison who invented it!" 

Tesla's name cannot be found in any Physics book of any school. Edison has been wrongly declared as the man who invented Electricity and the bulb. 

Edison (who was intimidated by his employee Tesla's genius), is famous for saying " Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration" . He was speaking for himself. What Edison sweated over for one month with an army of scientists -- Tesla could do alone in an minute. 

For Edison was not an inventor -- He was just a Innovator --nay-- a manager of minds , like how Bill Gates manages hundreds of programmers.

After Tesla left Edison he has said " If Edison had a needle to find in a haystack, he would proceed at once with the diligence of the bee to examine straw after straw until he found the object of his search. ... I was a sorry witness of such doings, knowing that a little theory and calculation would have saved him ninety percent of his labor " -- it was the anguish of a horse working for a donkey.



Destiny made Tesla and the Indian spiritual master Vivekananda meet in 1903. The meeting was arranged by French actress Sarah Benhardt. 





Sarah , the most famous actress of her time was in love with Tesla, who was reputed to be the most eligible bachelor of USA. Finding that Tesla studiously ignored her seductions , she dropped her perfumed lace handkerchief , forcing the debonair Tesla , to pick it up and give it back to her-- kick starting a conversation . She died a spinster.

Rudyard Kipling ( born in India ) and Mark Twain also wanted the meeting regarding MIND OVER MATTER , COSMIC FREE ENERGY and the AKASHIK AETHER FIELD to happen. They felt the planet deserved this union of classical science and quantum consciousness.




After the meeting , which forged Tesla's professional destiny -- Tesla started using Sanskrit words like Akasha for Aether ( Zero point field )and Prana in his writings. He developed a penchant for Copper Lotas ( which Himalayan Yogis use ) and became a vegetarian.

Hymn in Rig Veda about Ether written 7000 years ago.



There were vested interests influenced by Vatican, already miffed by the fact that Tesla was an Orthodox Christian, who do not recognise the Pope -- and now this -- 6000 year old Pseudo Science of Indian Vedas, all written in gibberish hymns by Hindu coolies.. 


Tesla's personal destiny was also affected. He had dozens of the most beautiful , intelligent and rich women vying for his love. Tesla decided to be celebate like Vivekananda , to harness and focus his mind to science . 



           


             
Few of such women were Anna Morgan, daughter of his financier JP Morgan ( who kept trying to seduce him in his lab where he worked 21 hours a day--she died, a spinster  ) , Katherine Underwood Johnson, his best friend's wife ( her love letters were found in his room after his death ) , Marguerite Merrington ( Tesla had feelings for her ) , Ava Astor, Corine Robinson, Flora Dodge, Catherine Moth etc etc

Despite Tesla’s genius and global occult status , ultimately it was others who made great fortunes based on his inventions. He passed away quietly penniless, alone and virtually forgotten...until now.

Today the international unit of magnetic flux density is called "Tesla". All magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines are calibrated with Tesla Unit (from 0.2 Tesla to 9 Tesla). 

Most Tesla technologies are used by military for HAARP (capable of projecting 4 gigawatts of power into the ionosphere to doctor it) , scalar psychotronics ( for mass mind control ), and star wars -- from papers stolen from his hotel room before his dead body could be discovered, by his maid, Alice Monaghan



I PREDICT--ONE DAY THIS FACE WILL BE AS FAMOUS AND SOUGHT AFTER FOR A TATTOO-- LIKE THAT OF CHE GUEVARA.

EGO-- FOUNTAINHEAD OF UNHAPPINESS -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL









Ship Management companies, Ship captains , HRD management pundits and the common man will benefit from this piece. 

Placing your ego on the back burner is the first step in realizing one's potential, having a happy family life and living in harmony with society. 



It is a wise thing to drop your ego once you get married. What ego calls love is actually possessiveness that can turn into hate within a second. Human love is limited because ego and selfishness is contained in it 

Emily Post , the etiquette czarina requires a genteel lady to crook her little finger while holding the tea cup— out of sheer “ consideration for other people ” — what nonsense !


The ego thrives on others and lives on attention . Human ego demands personal recognition and wastes energy in resentment if it does not get enough. The underlying emotion for the ego is fear, the fear of being a nobody. 


There is always a sense of insecurity around the ego even if on the outside it appears confident , perfumed and powdered. Ego strengthens itself by diminishing others—the uncultured females who had no clue of how the little finger must be crooked. 


Ego is insanity of the human mind. Unhappiness is an ego created mental cum emotional disease. The chatter of the ego continuously disrupts the natural state of well being. Stress is from within the mind , not by external threat. Ego creates suffering without recognising it.



Many people carry large amount of unnecessary baggage, both mental and emotional through out their lives. They hang on to the old emotion to strengthen their identity. 

Let me go beyond insignificant Emily Post , to leaders and Managers of Companies. 

I can already see lot of my colleagues smiling wryly. 

It’s hard to get into the boardrooms and MD offices of some organizations because the egos of the leaders take up way too much space. Only bootlickers and hand kissers are allowed into their inner sanctum. They recruit yes-men instead of capable men. 



Their own agenda is always ahead of the business agenda. They would disagree with someone’s point just because the is the one who said it. Their ego makes them take everything personally. They mistake a short memory for a clear conscience and are miserabe within.


They are unable to listen to another person's view without feeling threatened. They leave debris and destruction wherever they go. They are very eager to see their picture or name on the cover of a business periodical . 

Their Indifference arises due to ego. Their ego cannot distinguish between a situation and their interpretation and reaction to that situation. Cooperation is alien to ego except when there is a secondary motive. The ego becomes the grit in the system that gets in the way of authentic meaningful communication. 

Their self-talk is the mouthpiece of ego, Their inflated, overbearing egos create rules for rules’ sake. They complicate procedures , squash good ideas and keep good people down. 


Their ego makes them unwilling to admit that they know zilch about a subject in a meeting—the equivalent of the ear trying to tell what it saw and tasted and smelt, in a bulldozing manner. They brood endlessly on their petty grievances, never held before them any vision that might have lifted them out of themselves. They substitute their thinking capabilities with their loud cynical talking capabilities.

Compulsive liars are driven by egos feelings of insufficiency.. Ego will force them to make life difficult for others—for they feel the need to put people in their place or get into one-upmanship games.


“ If you want to test a man’s character, give him power.” -- Abraham Lincoln.

Such wretched people would give only conditional love to a small child or a kitten.


Enough on these wretched self righteous leaders, infatuated with their own brilliance , self delusions of grandeur and hidden agendas. 

Let us move on.

Road rage has become very common these days. The offence will be small but our reaction would be ridiculous—here it is the power of his car’s engine.. 




Ego tries to enlarge and strengthen by forming gangs and posses. Here the ego has simply shifted from the personal to the collective.

An immature leader douses the spark of creativity, rather than fan it, for the bottom line is always about him.

Your ego can prevent you from being an effective and truly great leader. Ego, popularly conceived as an over-inflated sense of self-importance, is a major stumbling block to effective leadership. 

Good leaders surround themselves with talented, outspoken individuals, not yes- men. Leadership is not an ego game!

Ego confuses opinions with facts . Every ego is a master of selective perception and distorted interpretation. Ego likes to judge and be right. You have a problem if you allow your ego to supersede your common sense.


Ego drives us on to greatness, then thrashes us soundly when we let it get out of control. Ego is a demanding unforgiving parasite . To the ego the present moment NOW hardly exists and is always concerned with keeping the past alive. Ego looks at the present with jaundiced eyes of the past. 

When people argue they will act as if they are fighting for survival and there is a imminent need to win at all costs. Such is the self delusion caused by ego. The ego thrives on reactivity.


The ego burns up considerable amounts of energy. 


People with king sized egos , when they suddenly fall ill suddenly become nice and gentle and humble—for the hospital is a great leveler.. But alas, when they get better energy returns and so does the ego. Every ego is therefore schizophrenic – with split personality.

There is no ego in telling the waiter that there is a cockroach in your cold soup. To be free of ego all you need to do is to be aware of your thoughts and emotions as they happen. Awareness and ego cannot coexist. It is difficult to see one's own ego. 


You can be sure you are correct, but then you have no right to take away people’s dignity to prove yourself. Let people see your soft side. This will make you much more endearing. Done properly it will not be perceived as weakness . It will make you more approachable and believable. 

Surround yourself with equally capable and strong-willed people. Give them permission to disagree with you , on a regular basis.


There is a fine line between pride and arrogance, that line is called EGO. The danger zone is when you start thinking that your accomplishments earn you the right to be condescending, obnoxious and abusive. Arrogance is having an attitude of superiority, delighting in your own significance and thriving on others feelings of inferiority.

The person with a king sized ego, will understand the whole of the planet,, but he will not understand what his own ego is doing to him. The left brain lobe is the home of his ego. It is the nature of ego to take and that of spirit to give. Since leadership is of spirit, the ego powered men can never be good leaders--they can never rise over the post of a mangy manager. It is the nature of the right brain lobe, to be accepting and free of judgements. Ego makes a donkey think that he is THE champion race horse.


Murderers in the death row have in the last few hours experienced the ego less state and the deep joy and peace that comes along with it.

Even Saddam Hussain agreed to wear the black hood on his head without protest before he was hanged , in front of several people —under normal circumstances he would have spat on the man who suggested it to him.


The PARADOX is that suffering caused by the ego eventually destroys the ego. When ego disappears , bliss enters.

MILK , BEER BELLY AND GLOBAL WARMING --- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL






Quarter century ago , i was known as the hard case non conformist sailor , who would not give milk to his own son.

Yes - after mothers milk, i banned my childern from having cow's milk--sneding my parents into a tizzy. My children could have cow's milk only if they had to take oral antibiotics -- to form a protective sludge layer in their stomachs and intestines. But i would allow my children Yoghurt ( friendly bacteria ).

A decade later, one of my friends excitedly rang me up and said Maneka Gandhi ( a minister ) had come on national DD TV , and said exactly what i have been saying -- THAT COWS' MILK IS TOXIC AND THAT NO ANIMAL DRINKS THE MILK OF ANY OTHER ANIMAL. 

EVEN THE COW DOES NOT ALLOW ITS OWN CALF TO DRINK MILK AFTER THE MANDATORY WEANING PERIOD OF 6 MONTHS IS OVER-- SHE JUST KICKS HER OWN CALF IF IT TRIES TO SUCKLE ON HER UDDER.

Cow releases milk only if she is fooled by taking her calf to it. In the west they suck it out forcefully using vacuum tubes , against the cow's wishes. The unhappy cow will definitely release harmful chemicals into the milk, which will do the human drinker no good.

Pasteurized milk (UHT - ultra-heat temperature) causes the milk protein (casein) to change to an inorganic form, which cannot be assimilated by the human body. This protein cannot be broken down, and hence it weakens the immune system, causing allergies , asthma, higher blood cholesterol and increased risk of heart disease and stroke. Pasteurization also destroys enzymes,diminishes vitamin content and kills healthy beneficial bacteria. 

The gooey mucus sticks on the inner wall of the intestines causes poor absorption of nutrients from your food. It causes constipation and can lead to many health problems, AS IT DAMAGES YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM.

Yes, cow's milk gives Calcium--but so does most of the other food you eat like brocolli, cabbage, nuts , sesame seeds, sea weeds, carrot etc. 

The ideal calcium to magnesium ratio for the human body should be 2:1. Milk's ratio is 10:1. By relying on cow's milk for calcium, you will have magnesium deficiency and imbalance.

For infants, if breast milk is not available, due to the mother;s health , substitute with goat's milk instead on cows milk. Mahatma Gandhi used to carry a goat with him for fresh milk, as he felt it was good for his brain . Even when he went to see the Queen in England, he took the goat with him on the ship , pissing off the Queen's reception party at the gangway.

Unlike the white man, Indians suffer from major lactose intolerance because we do not have the enzyme lactase that digests the milk sugar lactose . This causes gas in the intestines and a fuzzy brain. Methane fart gas is a global warming green house gas. 

Milk contains excessive calories and fats. Your sagging over the belt- beer belly , could be actually milk belly.

Cow's fart and belch ( methane gas ) is responsible for global warming. The cow lobby is so strong that nobody dares to rise a voice .

CORE VALUES -- WHAT MUST BE -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL













ETHICS, INNOVATION, TEAM DYNAMICS, COMPASSION-- ideal core values.

(Remember INTEGRITY is more than a core value --as it guarantees other values.)

Our company values are like fingerprints, we leave them all over everything we do. 

As is inherent in our company symbol, our core values obviously are --

1) High ethics. 

Welcome to the high moral ground where committing a felony even to support the company is not a career move . 

We rely on own merit to push a case, not blatant use of personal charm as a way to wheel and deal. Our company has a conscience . Our clean reputation and absence of deception is our biggest intangible asset which is reflected in our brand equity and not on our balance sheet. 

Our ethics are not abstract notions , but practical guides to employees on how to feel, act and behave. Ethical behavior is a habit in our company , not an act. All employees are part of the ethical fabric . 

We have a DEO ( designated ethics officer ) cum mentor to get this core value into the blood stream of the company , to oversee compliance , provide a frame work of conduct and to provide support to an employee who wants to do the right thing. 

Our ethics champion is no lesser than the MD himself , with a moral barometer and an ethics radar to do ethical climate assessment. There exists a strong belief that it is acceptable to deliver bad news to the company or raise personal concerns. 

Our mature ethics programmes have reduced voluminous codes of conduct to just a few sub core values like fairness, integrity, transparency, respect , tolerance for culture, responsibility , spirit of inclusion etc. Seminars are used to clarify ethics values , as sustaining an ethical culture is a continuous process without a finish line. 

We trust our employees to do the right thing when confronted with a situation that provides no easy answers. We don’t have yes-men who will not tell the truth to safeguard their jobs. We temper all technical judgments by the need to support and maintain human values. 

We honour our contracts and don’t cut corners. We do not allow conflicts of interest, which provide a competitive advantage to one client over another. We respect the intellectual property rights of our clients, and guard them zealously. 

We do not advertise ourselves or our services in a deceptive manner, and will not misrepresent or allow the misrepresentation of the services by affiliates, associates, contractors, employees, partners and vendors. 

We do not promote our own interest at the expense of the dignity of the marine profession. We obey the law in both letter and spirit. We maintain a safe and healthy working environment. 

We do not encourage nepotism, fully aware that blood is a poor substitute for competence. 

##########
2) Innovation 

There is something about innovation that quickens our collective hearts. We recognize there is no such thing as instant innovation. The farmer must invest in the soil before he reaps a rich harvest. We nurture a climate where innovation happens. 

Innovation at our neck of the woods is evolutionary not a revolutionary panic response to change . To innovate is not to reform, but to bring useful change. Changes need not be innovations but innovations are changes. Application of creativity is innovation. 

We recognize that bureaucracy kills creativity. We encourage our people to use their imagination , listen to their their inner voice and use all their six senses to check assumptions and apply their creativity. We encourage creative dissent and we protect human feelings. 

We brainstorm often to get feedback. We have a commitment not to allow our policies , procedures and rituals to get in the way of innovation. We can sense the drift of change and ensure that we are aligned to it in advance as surely as a ship enters a narrow channel. We take change by hand before it takes us by the throat. We give recognition to creative thinkers and innovative doers . 

We don’t try to get our creative wild geese to fly in military formation. We recruit people who have the seeds of the future within them. Innovate or die—is our slogan . 

Our organisational gatekeepers frame the environment that enables innovation, however innovation is enacted – recognised, developed, applied and adopted – through individual employees.. 

##########
3) Dynamics 

We have reinvented team dynamics . Our team is a dynamic whole based on interdependence rather than on similarity or cloning. Our team acts in unity , almost like a single living organism, that requires to be nurtured to maintain its growth. We understand team chemistry—the natural forces at play, to determine whether they are acting for ill or good and can make timely interventions to make the dynamics positive. 

Our people are harmonious team players and there is a natural force of inclusion which results in transparent communications. They inspire the highest level of commitment from each other. Everyone is accountable to one another. They share similar values, attitudes, ideals and goals . 

Proper team dynamics ensures extraordinary results .Team dynamics consists of critical areas such as personal abilities, educational backgrounds, life experiences and personality compatibility of each exclusive teammate . 

Our HR department does TDP ( Team Dynamics Profiling ) to give us concrete indications on how the team will bond, interact and ultimately perform. Our seminars are basically team retreats where we enjoy our team rituals, chants and gleeful routines. 

We encourage each person in the team to give both positive and negative feedback. We choose team players who will complement each other, rather than exclude each other, no matter what superstars they are.

What we require is not well balanced individuals, rather individuals who balance well with each other . We devise strategies so that team players can feed off each other rather than cancelling out each other. Thus we remain united in our pursuit of our goals, resistant to disruptive forces. 

Our inspirational team leadership uses emotional impact. We afford an inspirational environment to our high performance teams . Communications in our Company is a group process, and mutual trust and respect are maintained in order to keep the channels open. No body's perfect , but we believe that our team is. 

Our team can produce a quality and quantity of work far higher than the sum of what the separate members could have ever produced on their own. Collective synergy of experience and expertise, accented with harmony, loyalty and camaraderie is indisputably our core asset. 

########
4) Compassion 

We respect and appreciate culture in terms of itself. We are sensitive to cultural nuances . We listen and we respect local values . We think globally, but act locally. We understand that culture has a life of its own and is stronger than life and triumphs over death. We believe human beings have feelings unlike machines. 

Our human resources are not mere dehumanized code numbers or cheap labour to be exploited, thereby breeding indifference. They are our biggest assets. We recognize that people are not things and they need to be led and motivated rather than being managed.. When people do their jobs we get out of their way. 

We recognise that our employees are bread winners at home. Our company can grow only if our employees grow. We run a innovative organization which relies more upon shared ethos, than adherence to hard written rules. We have people feel and our HR dept knows how to monitor the pulse of our employees. 

If at all we criticize we do so in a constructive manner. We do not manipulate by unfair or insidious means. We assure the psychological, safety and social needs of our staff. No wonder our staff is eager to walk that extra mile to get things right— the XXXXX way. 

These core values represent our brand promise.

COMMENTS:

I have worked for a lot of ignorant companies, who confuse goals with values. Their collective noses are stuck forever in a knothole. They get their knickers in a twist when they are reminded that --

"A goal is something you intend to accomplish. A value is something you believe in" 

It is better to keep away from such immature rubbish.

THE LASCAR-- THE ORIGINAL INDIAN MERCHANT NAVY SAILOR -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL










Today Indian sailors are everywhere on Oil tankers, Chemical tankers and other ships. -- valued and in great demand for their mental acuity and seafaring skills. 

He was just a Lascar -- A brazen form slavery re-invented by the white man.

Indian seamen unions like Maritime Union of Indian ( MUI ), NUSI etc should keep a picture of a white man Mr.Joseph Salter in their offices-- lest we are branded an ungrateful race.


I myself ( the evolved lascar ) have commanded British flag ships with British and European officers. 

4 centuries ago, the Lascar was a derogatory term for the “ wretched Khalasi sailor of mongrel descent ” or “ The Indian coolie “ . 

The white man hardly knew that this coolie belongs to the world's first civilization.  The Vedic civilisation flourished on the banks of river Saraswati from 9000 BC to 4000 BC .  The river dried up in 4000 BC due to tectonic shifts blocking the glacial mouth in the Himalayas. The white man came out from under the Quaternary ice age only in 9500 BC, doing grunt grunt, staying in dark caves , wearing barks, eating raw meat.  At this time the predecessors of the Indian Lascar  were writing poetry, wearing woven clothes, eating from a cooked menu and living in proper stone houses.

Lascars were Indian sailors who worked on British and European ships for 400 years.



Lascars played a valuable role, helping to crew British ships in times of peace and war and ensuring that goods from India and beyond arrived safely in London and other British ports.



Lascars served on British ships under 'lascar' articles of agreement. These agreements allowed shipowners to pay a pittance of 5% of the white sailors wages for longer working hours , give less and poor quality food , and force them to stay in unventilated , cramped and dingy areas of ship unfit for humans . 


The sailors could be transferred from one ship to another and retained in service for up to three years at one time. Indian lascars served as the deck crew; in the engine rooms below the decks as coal Stokers or Aagwallas . 

Goan lascars being Christians catholics were allowed easier jobs of Stewards and cooks. They could handle pork and beef and were even more servile.. 

Digression:-- (This tradition has lived on in Goa, and as a result a obscene percentage of Goan christian population work as stewards and butlers on land too . This has altered their DNA programming / blue print , determination and mindset -- and you will rarely see a Goan catholic with Portugese surname PASSING A IIT ENTRANCE EXAM . That Goa got rid of slavery, and Portugese Rama Rajya in 1962, instead of 1947 like the rest of India is also a huge cause.)

Stoking, a terrible task which was deemed to be below the dignity of a white man. At the beginning of the voyage, the large pile of coal lay near the entry to the bunkers. But as the voyage continued, the coal was used up and its face receded, forcing trimmers deeper into the hot, unventilated, dust-filled bunkers. 



Lascars were both recruited to serve on European ships and paid through a Ghat Serang, an Indian shore agent, with vested interests ( on the payroll of the shipowners ). The Jahaz Serang is the Bosun or nowadays.

The ship owners loved the lascars as they were docile unlike the unruly whites.

Their unions’ use of ‘coolie’ and ‘lascar’ also constituted discursive tactics of denial and exclusion. The Ghat Serangs applied strong arm tactics , including arrest ( assisted by the British and Portugese governments ) to recruit the Lascars.

In 1916/17 hundreds of Lascars elected to join the British labour corps in Mesopotamia rather than go to sea. This choice made sense. Mesopotamia paid better and was believed to be safer.

As trade expanded and India became increasingly central to Britain's global trade and economy, lascars became the mainstay of the labour force in British-registered ships bound for Europe. Yet lascars have not been granted the place they deserve in studies of British maritime history. The British museum at London displays shows vandalised and stolen goods , but talks nothing of the Indentured Coolie and Lascars. 

Because of the nature of the trade, and the imbalance of exports from Britain against imports from India, lascars were forced to remain in England for long periods of time before ships were ready to take them back leaving lascars destitute. They were stranded in London by a series of laws called the Navigation Acts. These Acts meant that many Indian sailors arriving in London from India could not be re-employed on return journeys and were abandoned.

Impoverished , ill clad and shivering Lascars would be wandering the streets of various ports for survival in England ,Scotland, Wales and Ireland – peddling , begging in front of street art , sweeping streets , taking up low paid menial jobs etc. They would sleep on the streets or inside dockside sheds . 



Some of them even took on white wives . They were in demand as they had no problems in getting that elusive hard on , without excessive nauseating foreplay and liquor , even in the cold-- and infidelity was not a concern. 



By 1795 few ports gave temporary -- dirty , pestilent and deplorable barrack homes to Lascars, at London, Southampton, Cardiff, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow. 

Only in 1850 did the Admiralty had taken over responsibility for the welfare of distressed Lascars—after some visiting Indian princes, including Maharaj Dilip Singh gave hefty donations. .

Only a handful of Lascars are mentioned on the memorial at Tower Hill with the names of 26,833 seamen of the British Merchant Navy who died in the carnage of both world wars. Why not? They were animals , not human , right?

Joseph Salter a missionary in the Chapel Street district of London (now Edgware Road) helped the lascars from 1853 . It is on record that in sixteen years more than sixteen thousand Lascars visited the homes and over thirteen hundred were fed and clothed. 

" The Strangers home" survived until 1935, when it was converted into flats and named West India House by Stepney Borough Council. For thirty-nine years Joseph Salter served the community of Lascars as helper and teacher . 

All that remains however, is a street named after him in the east end of London. 

This selfless man ,should have been honoured like Mother Theresa . He was not interested in photo shoots, and grabbing the limelight , and using his white skin for leverage , like the saint Theresa.

IT IS A SHAME THAT NONE OF THE INDIAN SAILOR ORGANISATIONS , LIKE MUI, NUSI ETC HAS EVEN A PICTURE OF THIS MAN IN THE SAILORS CLUBS , SHELTERS AND OFFICES.


##############

Here is an extract of a long poem about lascars , written by a certain Mary Robinson.

Far from my Native Indian shore,
I hear our wretched race deplore;
I mark the smile of taunting Scorn,
And curse the hour, when I was born !
I weep, but no one gently tries
To stop my tear, or check my sighs;
For, while my heart beats mournfully,
Dear Indian home, I sigh for Thee !
To drink the tear of deep despair;
The scoff and scorn of fools to bear !
And if I curse my fate severe,
Some Christian Savage mocks my tear !
Was it for this, the LASCAR brave
"Toil'd, like a wretched Indian Slave

The Lascar's pendulum swung to the other extreme, and in the 1970s' there was unwarranted militant trade unionism supporting lazy young sailors who will not work (unless given excessive overtime) , displayed gross lack of respect, decorum etc.

As a result most foreign companies do NOT want Indian crew on their ships -- 

-- they however love to employ Indian senior officers on tankers , where one mistake can wipe out the whole company. 


Who invented the ship's compass?  
When the pyramids were built 5000 years ago, NOBODY on this planet including the Egyptians has the technology to find the exact North East South West cardinal positions of Vaastu. Nobody on the planet had an idea what is sun's declination or Kepler’s precession via astronomy . The geographic and the magnetic poles are NOT the same. The North pole is 1600 miles away and the south pole is 2570 kilometers away.
The ancient Kerala sailors sailed to Socotra and Aquaba and Basra using a compass of magnetised fish blade floating on light oil floating on water. This is symbolised by Arjun shooting into the eye of the fish to win Draupadi in 4000 BC.

SPANISH CRUELTY AND EXTREME SADISM -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL






















When a ship docks in a Spanish port, and you put on TVE the national TV network, in prime time you get to see Spanish cruelty to animals---

-- with even small girls clapping in sadistic gratification on feeling the animal's fear , hearing agonising screams and seeing spilt blood. 

The stadiums are usually chock-a-block , both with curious tourists and die-hard fans. Bullfighting has been popular in Spain since the time of Emperor Claudius two thousand years ago.

Thousands of bulls die in the fiestas which take place across Spain , where there are no animal-protection laws. Different torture games are held like donkey chasing, Quail catapulting, and the nightmarish festival known as "Toro Jubilo" where the bull’s horn are set on fire.

The bizarre "Toro Jubilo" is held in Soria, Spain. The bulls' horns tied with pitch rags are then set on fire, and the terrified animals are released to run madly through the streets—are left to burn. For hours, the tar burns like a bonfire on the bulls' heads, scorching their faces, eyes, and bodies. 

Many burning bulls slip and crash into walls in agony and blind terror. The bull’s tail is wrenched off and its testicles are mounted on a spear and paraded around by cheering crowds.

Their carcasses are later divided among the participants for consumption. The residents apparently believe that consuming the adrenaline laden flesh of the tortured animals confers fertility and invincibility. 

Spanish Greyhounds, the galgo is used by Spanish hunters to pursue and capture prey. They are by nature docile, gentle and affectionate dogs, yet the destiny of many thousands of galgos each year, once the hunting season ends, is to be ritually tortured and killed by the cruelest methods imaginable, for the entertainment of their owners.

In the 16th century, Catholic Spain was the great continental power. Spaniards were described by the rest of Europe as cruel barbarians, greedy, treacherous, ignorant, and narrow.

In South America where the National Language is Spanish, you hardly find any natives. In Portugese areas you can still find the original inhabitants. Under the pretext of introducing Native Americans to Christianity, the Spanish ruthlessly massacred native populations and enslaved them in some of the most cruel slave practices ever seen on the face of the earth.

The average Native American slave lasted less than a year under his Spanish masters. They held that Native Americans were only part human and so had no legal or spiritual privileges. 

By the time the British took over Jamaica in 1655, the entire 100000 population of gentle native Arawaks , were decimated by the Castilian Spaniards. Towards the later stages these oppressed people decided that suicide was better than the ordeal of Spanish rule, and they poisoned their babies and killed themselves.

The gross disregard for human lives and bizarre sadism is characteristic of the Spanish Inquisition which killed 8 million people. In the 15th century King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella (under papal rule) acquired permission from the Catholic Church to target those people suspected of Muslim, Jewish or heretical beliefs to root out through the application of torture those who, although posing as devout Catholics, were secretly practicing religions considered non-conformist by the Catholic hierarchy. 

As a direct result of this Papal permission and authorization the Spanish Inquisition was born. Thousands were paraded before pseudo courts to face the sadistic rulings of Inquisition judges. It was also used as an instrument of terror and torment against scientists, philosophers, and members of the Christian Church , who were believed to be irreverent toward the authority of the Catholic Church and its agencies. 

There were a variety of sadist methods used by the agents of the Inquisition to force victims to "confess" to heresy or to sins or crimes against the Church. The rack and is perhaps the most infamous of all the torture implements used in this period.

The unfortunate victim was tied or strapped to a board by the wrists and ankles to two rollers. Then the rollers were turned in opposite directions, thus slowly stretching the victim until the limbs popped from their sockets or the body was broken. 

It was noted that a person who refused to talk even under torture was being aided by the devil. While the poor victim was being tortured a clerk recorded what was said. They sprayed there instruments with so called holy water, wore amulets, herbs and crossed themselves in a bizarre manner.

Other practices that were prevalent in the Middle Ages were to tear out the tongue. To blind the victim with sharp sticks or red-hot iron spikes. The pulling of the flesh with pliers. The skinning of the accused alive. Quartering (in which the victims intestines would be pulled from the body) and impaling, in which a stake would be hammered through the victim’s body avoiding the vital organs, resulting in a slow death that could last for hours or days.

A sharp iron fork was used to mangle breasts. Red hot pincers were used to tear off flesh. Red hot irons were inserted up vaginas and rectums. A device named the turcas was used to tear out fingernails. After the nails were ripped out needles were shoved in. Boots called bootikens were used to lacerate flesh and crush bone. 

Thumbscrews were used to crush the fingers and toes. Acid was poured on victims and hands were immersed into pots of boiling oil and water. Eyes were gouged out by irons. Alcohol was poured on the head of the poor victim and set alight. Water was poured down the victims throat with a knotted cloth. The cloth was then jerked out tearing up the victims bowels.

There was no limit to the types and cruelty of the tortures. The inquisition meant anything was allowed. The inquisitors were sadistic and mentally disturbed. An "Inquisition" was supposed to be a legal inquiry by the church.

On June 30, 1680, in the area of Madrid, 51 outcasts were roasted alive in a orgy of torture that lasted 14 hours and was held as a grisly celebration to commemorate the marriage of Carlos II to Marie d’ Orleans. The king himself gleefully set light to the first human bonfire.

Even after the poor victims confessed to things they never did more torture was to follow. On the way to the stake or gallows victims were flogged, burned, branded and had their hands and tongues hacked off. 

By the 17th century as the catholic church began to lose power the inquisition began to collapse. In 1870 the Papacy lost control of the Papal States and was left thankfully with only the territory of the Vatican City . 

8 million had died as a result of the inquisition, including men, women, children and babies.

ALEXANDER THE GREAT AND KING PORUS -- THE HIDDEN TRUTH-- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL
























WHITE LIES , THE SUPER HORSE BUCEPHALUS , AND THE MIGHTY ELEPHANT.

We all know the Greek and western poetry about the heroics of Alexander the Great, who invaded India in 326 BC and had King Porus on his knees. There are coloured paintings of this scene in most western museums.

The truth is totally different.

It is never too late to know the truth.

Alexander did self marketing and he had a horde of historians , painters and poets embedded in his army who wrote exactly what he wanted--to portray him larger than his five feet five inches of height.

Porus was a minor king of India, not finding mention anywhere except in the Battle of Hydaspes -- and that too by western accounts.

King Porus 's actual name is Purushottam ( some call him Parvateshwar ),the Puruvanshi king. He ruled the kingdom of Paurava in Punjab . He stood a majestic seven feet four inches tall-- taller than the huge Great Khali wrestler of WWF. . He was not in good terms with the King of Taxila.

King Alexander knew about this and he gave the King of Taxila 25 tonnes of gold which he had plundered from Persia, (after the battle of Gaugamela) , as a bribe to ally with him. For he had heard that Porus had 85 elephants in his army and his own Greek army had never battled the war elephant.




On the way to battle Porus, Alexander's soldiers were psychologically battered.  The soldiers saw astounding scenes of  holy men hanging upside down from trees, and meditating, and it was apparent they had been doing it for a long time. If they fall asleep they would die.  The guides of the army of Alexander were pupils of a professor from Taxila university by the name of Chanakya, the advisor to Mauryan empire .







Alexander has also heard from his wife Roxxane , ( daughter of a Bactrian noble Oxyartus ), that the the Nandas of the Magadha Kingdom had 6000 war elephants ( count by Plutarch ) and the Emperor 

Chandragupta Maurya of the Mauryan Empire had 9000 war elephants. They also had hordes of Tibetan Mastiff dogs who could kill leopards and whip up a booming barking frenzy which terrified men and horses.

His cavalry horses would be no match for the mighty elephants.

His own Thessalian black stallion Bucephalus who was his body extension in a battle field and placed him in the zone , was a nervous animal prone to psychological mental blows.. For 10 years Becephalus however had served him very well in the thick of battle.

He knew that the elephants had protective fort like stable platforms ( fort like howdah ) ,on their backs from where archers shot accurate armour piercing fire arrows from crossbows. Before battle the elephants would be given a potion which made them run fast , absolutely fearless and trumpet happy.

They could also swing heavy iron spiked balls held by chains with their trunks to swipe at horses, who would be terrified by the elephants sights and sounds in any case. The elephant is a more intelligent animal than a horse in a dynamic battle. If an elephant is wounded in battle it becomes very proactive and fearsome.

Note :  The white historian lied when he wrote that the mighty Maurya empire was formed AFTER Alexander the great died.  Sorry, the united Maurya empire was formed BEFORE Alexander the great came to India. The only thing is that the King Chandra Gupta Maurya did NOT have to engage the Greeks.  The whole idea of the lying white historian was to say Alexander went back from India, NOT because he was scared of mighty Indian kings , but because his army was TIRED.  His army was NOT tired.  Alexander rotated his army, new soldiers joined up regularly and the older lot went back to Greece with stolen goodies.

In the battle field Alexander noted in his records that huge and handsome Porus on his mighty elephant looked the same proportion as a greek soldier to his horse.

In the bloody battle, at Lilla, Mong on the banks of river Jhelum, Porus lost his young son. Alexander lost his horse Bucephalus done in by Prince Amar , Porus's brother.  He also lost his brave Greek General Nicaea.




Both were physically wounded too and were not mentally geared to fight--of course one was the deflated invader who had bitten off more than what he could chew  --and the other the resolute defender, ready to take on the greedy invader.

Alexander had just lost his Harley Davidson bike ( his horse ) which he rode on all his battles for 10 years-- and was now unable to even ride a bicycle. He was a pathetic shadow of the fierce and proud warrior he once was-- and his soldiers were surprised to see the change .





There was NO point in defeating Porus , even if he could  -- and setting the mighty Nandas and Maurya's after him for sure. The Mauryas had a Ayurveda surgeon turned military strategist ( Chanakya  the professor at Taxila )  in charge , known for his mental acumn.

Initially, a demoralised Alexander send the Ambhi the King of Taxila for truce. Porus got furious on seeing the traitor Indian king and threw a spear at him and drove him away.

Porus was poised to deliver the final blow.

Alexander now played the ace up his slimy sleeve.

He dishonorably sent his Indian wife Roxana to tie a rakhi on Porus, to be his sister--an old Indian custom. It now became Porus's responsibility to ensure Alexander was safe -- an iron clad guarantee. The western mind cannot understand these Indian concepts .

Then Alexander send his own emissary to sue for peace. There was NO other way he would have got back to Greece in one piece.

After the truce , Alexander gave Porus "back" his Kingdom ( it was never taken away in the first place ) and added a few small kingdoms which he had captured to add to it-- not out of kindness but for self preservation. He had bitten off more than what he could chew.

In return Porus gave Alexander a few elephants , with instructions on how to use them in war and a Tibetan Mastiff --the ONLY dog who can ignore pain. He also gifted some diamonds ,-- India was the only source of diamonds in the world till the 19th century.


               
Porus gave Alexander a stock of living KATTARVAZHA ( the west call it Aloe Vela ) an Ayurvedic magic healing herb from Kerala ( it requires tropical soil ) to fast forward heal his wounds.



Alexander would NOT have survived without it.  He was told to stock up this herb on the way back from Socotra , where the Vedic Indians were growing it since 8000 BC , to make incense , for holy Yagnas and trade with the west. 

Socotra has some strange element in its soil to grow heavenly plants. St Thomas tried to get Aloe Vela on his passage to India (after Christ died) and got shipwrecked at Socotra, due to strong currents.

Digression: Alexander was a hardcore homosexual , just like his father. Why did he marry dark skinned Roxana, just before coming to India ?  And that too by antagonising his boyfriend and his personal hermaphrodite tent mate . 

It was for immediate political reasons--for the crucial alliance with King of Taxila.   His heir with Roxana would never be accepted by the Greeks , right? ( the way Indians have accepted Sonia Gandhi )



     
( Draupadi has put a tourniquet on Lord Krishna's bleeding wrist by tearing off a piece of her saree-- and in return Krishna had saved her from Dushasana who tried to strip her naked in public in 4000 BC --  starting a religious festival in India )



       
One village was named after the fallen super horse Bucephalus. This nervous horse could NOT suffer the infrasound of the mighty elephants roar-- nor of the Tibetan Mastiffs.

The Greeks did no go back to Greece the same way they came-- In consultation with Porus, Alexander sailed down the Indus and Jhelum rivers, to prevent ambush ( deadly poisoned arrows from hidden tree tops , from where a big percentage of Alexander's army was decimated ) and further encounters with elephants.

The Greeks were totally demoralised by this deadly tree top warfare. They were more used to their favourite turf of wide plains, where their own tactics worked.



Indians used thin arrows made of rosewood which could fly further , pierce greek armour , through and through and be very accurate.  The hidden archers were deadly.



After a few years Emperor Chandragupta Maurya set his 9000 elephants ( count by Megastenes ) on Seleucus Nicator, Alexander's Satrap and drove the 400000 Greeks away from India forever and retook Hindu Kush ie Afghanistan and Balochistan..



Chandra gupta also married Seleucus's daughter. In return Seleucus secured 500 mighty elephants.



The politics of Chandra Gupta's  master strategist Prime Minister Chanakya, who was a teacher in Taxila University ( the first world university of the planet, founded 3000 BC )  when Alexander invaded, is well documented in Indian history.  The immoral white historian has dated this university to 1000 BC, to show the world that Indian knowledge was NOT available from 3000 BC to 1000 BC, to the west.  





Chandragupta's grandson was Emperor Ashoka who gave us the Indian emblem (sic !).

Alexander came to the world's first civilization which existed on the banks of the river Saraswati from 9000 BC to 4000 BC.  In 4000 BC the glacial mouth of this river at Himalayas dried up, and the civilization died , forcing a mass exodus, shifting the focus to Ganges and the Indus valley civilization.  Aryans went OUTWARDS and never INWARDS.  The Rig Veda written in 5000 BC does not talk about the Ganges at all. 


In 7000 BC Aryan Indian Emperor Vikramaditya, based at Ujjain ( Khhpira river-- site of 12 yearly Kumbh Mela  )  ruled from Jerusalem to Urals to Cambodia.   It was he-- who gave and never took/ vandalised -- who spread the laws of Manu.

The power of the black meteorite stones at Mecca Kaaba , Jerusalem Dome of the rock , Petra ( this civilization died after the black stone was stolen ) and the temples of the far east were endorsed by Vikramaditya. In India wherever we saw this black stone we built a temple on it, and then a town grew outwards ( the equivalent of the quintessential western gold rush )

Chandragupta's grandson was Emperor Ashoka who gave us the Indian emblem (sic !).




   
In the epic " The life and exploits of Alexander " -- Ernest Alfred Wallis Budge who worked in the British museum in the 20th century, gives a blow by blow account of the peace treaty. He did not paint Alexander without his warts and did NOT prefer romantic lore churned out by embedded poets and writers , of the triumph of organised west over uncivilised east,--  to the naked truth..




History re-invented by “our white skin is superior historian “  says -- the Greek soldiers were HOME SICK and tire d -- when Alexander used to send a percentage of his army back home on leave every month with the loot and plunder  – The real reason was that they were scared of dying – for the army of the empires of Maurya and Nanda were indeed too much for Alexander’s motley army on mangy horses. They expunged the Maurya empire and claimed it was created after Alexander died.

HOME SICK INDEED!!!--    just 85 war elephants( of a minor Indian king , who never deserved a mention in Indian records  ) made them homesick and cry babies  --



When the western countries, came out from the quaternary ice age in 9500 BC, and were staying in caves, eating raw meat and doing grunt grunt, India was a great civilization, with kings staying in palaces, wearing silk and writing poetry in Sanskrit.

An employee German Max Mueller working for German Jews Rothschild, the owner of opium running British East India company, was told by Vatican to subvert world history to prove to all, that Bible dates are right. That the big bang of cosmos happened in 23rd Oct 4004 BC, 9 AM ( while it happened 14 billion years ago ) and that the great flood with Noah’s arc and party happened in 2500 BC ( life came on earth 4 billion years ago )  



By 5000 BC, the Indian Rig Veda was written in Sanskrit. Every religion and prayer on this planet is an offshoot of Hinduism and every language is an offshoot of Sanskrit. The Aryans went out of India, with their Swastika symbol ( inscribed on Shiva's son Ganesha's palm ) as modern DNA tests have proved, never into India, as contended by Hitler .


The Indian Shiva / Shakti merging  6 point star has been adopted by Jewish religion. Shiva Lingam stones of ex-pagan temples are the main attraction at Mecca Kaaba , Dome of the rock at Jerusalem and Vatican.

TO DO A DELAP-- TO INNOVATE-- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL









Rory Delap who plays for Stoke City in EPL, can throw a ball from the side lines with a FLAT trajectory to a distance of around 40 metres. 

It has the same effect as a corner kick, with the advantage of NO OFFSIDE. The ball starts off 7 feet higher than the ground . No defender can position himself due to the flatness of the trajectory.

This strikes terror into the hearts of the goalkeeper and defenders. Delap has been the reason for 50% of Stoke city’s goals.

No coach in the world has been able to figure out his secret, which is threatening the football world.

Today my 23 year old son soccer nut son was practicing the throw, with “ your truly” as the golden retriever.

My son has cracked the Delap code. He is not exactly dumb, as he is bound for Cornell University for doing his ME in Computer science. He has powerful shoulder muscles and tendons , as he works out at the gym.

What he does is to take a 4 short and one long stride just before the throw, dig his front foot in, allow the mental ball of energy to flow from the ground to his right hand finger tips ( like in a Kung fu punch where the energy comes from the waist jerk ) 

-- and release the ball using his right hand to deliver a spin, with the left hand held in position only to legalise the throw. The spin counters gravity and is accurate.

No slow motion camera can tell that this one handed throw is illegal—because technically the left palm and right palm releases the ball together..

Innovations can be best brought in by outsiders from the industry—they are not hampered by silly rules and limitations—they don’t even know the existence of such a rule. 

This is why language translater Inter Milan coach JOE MOURINHO is successful. Innovation has a lot to do with your ability to recognize unusual phenomena. If you cannot communicate you cannot innovate .

I think of innovation as the "best way" skill. 







Do not hesitate to break virtually every rule, held sacred by conventional wisdom. Always define the right outcomes, rather than the right steps, while coaching.

MATURITY LESSONS -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL








We live in a world where MATURITY is mistaken for being dour , mean and stiff upper lipped.

It takes a Capt Vadakayil to expose these misanthropes. 

An immature man must NEVER keep a dog as a pet--he should keep a cat, who will not hero worship him. ( Mindset: Cat — you are nothing but dust and ashes. Dog — for you the world was created.)

Read on to get a handle of maturity. It is not what the whole world and management school whizkid tell you.

A mature person lives according to the dictates of his own higher intelligence, not by whims and fancies. He does not have one foot in the past and one foot in the present to piss on the present. Right NOW— is the greatest moment of his life.

He knows the difference between what he cannot change and what he can. He knows what is his can never be taken away from him, while what has never been his will never stay with him. 

He knows that most people are neither for him nor against him-- they are thinking about themselves and the grind of life. He is aware that no matter what he does, some people aren’t going to love him – 

-- a lesson that is at first troubling and then quite relaxing. He knows that there is good and bad in all people and in all things he will think in absolutes, and is able to be objective even when deeply stirred emotionally. Thus the rate at which a person can mature is directly proportional to the embarrassment he can tolerate.

A mature man does not engage in self-destructive behaviour, or burn up his energy in anxiety. He is not addicted to self pity and resentment. In a mature relationship, there is acceptance— there is no covert attempt to change or straitjacket the other. 

He can enjoy the differences. For the foundation or a relationship is unconditional trust , transparency and freedom.

Maturity is the ability to do a job without being supervised. The ability to bear an injustice without wanting to get even. It is the capacity to endure uncertainty. 

It is the ability to laugh at yourself. The ability to think, speak and act within the framework of dignity — MATURITY, IS KNOWING WHEN TO BE IMMATURE AND DERIVE SOME HAPPINESS FOR YOURSELF AND THE OTHERS. ( is the policeman in the picture , immature? )

He can communicate freely and understand the others point of view. He can give unconditional love.

In proactive behavior there is a pause between stimulus and response ( not a knee jerk reaction )— for making a suitable choice of response. This does not mean he is hypocritic politician. He is truthful without being cruel and lives life with compassion.

No one can be a threat to a mature man as he is the fountainhead of his own solutions. A mature man believes in himself and he is not dying or craving for the approval or gratitude of others. 

He does not care for success at the cost of his dignity and honour. He will not let criticism or public opinion upset him. When your CONSCIENCE dictates your life, no one else can.

He will say what he wants to— but in an appropriate manner. He will reject what others say— but in a logical manner. He will maintain his self respect— and respect others, who deserve his respect.

A mature man knows that the difference between a loser and a winner is the difference in the readiness to learn and change, and not being bullheaded about it.. 

He will avoid sarcasm, yelling, emotional outbursts when mistakes occur.

A flexible person is always happier than a rigid one. Flexibility is a sign of life. Rigidity , its absence.

A mature man knows the principles of dynamic risk assessment and can imagine the WCS ( worst case scenario ).

When people talk about you behind your back, it confirms that you are important enough. No one kicks a dead dog. 

When you cannot forgive someone you are chained to him by hatred and bitterness. So when you forgive the wrong doer it is a perfectly selfish act.

Mature people have the ability to focus on important things.. They can resign with good grace whatever they are not.. the eye wont insist that it can hear. They will not allow yesterday to use too much of today.

There is no reality — only perception. It is up to you to perceive things the way you want to. 

Strike the right balance between effort and resignation . 

Be yourself. Get better at listening to your own drummer.

RESPECT CULTURE-- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL








CULTURE — CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL

from a man who has sailed around the world for 3.5 decades and worked with with alien cultures for long -

- and can think crystal clear!

it is well known that Indians have the oldest culture in the world-- the Saraswati river Vedic civilization is the oldest in the world --it thrived from 9000 BC to 4000 BC.

culture should be appreciated in terms of itself.

what is moral in one culture might be immoral or ethically neutral in another .

culture is that complex whole -- which is a potpourri of language, ideas, beliefs, customs, codes, institutions, tools, techniques, art, rituals, knowledge, morals ,law, habits , folktales , values,
conventions, ceremonies etc etc --- snowballed by man as a member of the society.

the use of culture depends upon an ability for rational or abstract possessed by humans alone. animals dont have it.

culture could be a logical construct, or a psychic defense mechanism or even an abstraction from behaviour.

once established, culture has a life of its own, in a CAUSE AND EFFECT --YIN-YANG relationship--

it flows down through time from one generation to another. it is the most highly developed means of promoting freedom from worry and continuity of life, in a series that began with the simple reflex.

man's immediate prehuman ancestors had societies, but they did not have culture.
it can cause a person to die of hunger, though nourishment is available, because some foods are branded unclean by the culture. and it can cause a person to disembowel or shoot himself to wipe out a stain of dishonour.

culture is stronger than life and stronger than death. culture triumphs over death and offers man eternal life.

wife lending among the eskimo might be practiced as a gesture of hospitality, a way of cementing a friendship and promoting brotherhood in a unforgiving and dangerous environment, and thus may acquire the status of a high moral value.

cultures themselves must NEVER EVER be evaluated or graded as higher and lower, superior or inferior.

a culture is a time tested means to an end-- the culture ( or way of life ) of the more highly developed nation is “imposed” upon the less developed peoples .

now-a-days it is fashion -- to use word culture mindlessly like corporate culture, computer culture, or alien culture , -- here it is CULTURAL --- not culture.

in anthropology and sociology we apply culture clashes, culture shock, and counter- culture (like eating from same plate--)

in a nutshell -- RESPECT CULTURE--

MUSCLE SORENESS , LACTIC ACID AND ANAEROBIC ATP -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL









Human cellular produce adenosine triphosphate ATP is also known as the energy of life. Muscles use ATP as an energy source. 

The cardiovascular system is limited in its ability to quickly deliver blood and oxygen to the working muscles. Because of this, during high intensity exercise, ATP is also provided by anaerobic metabolism that don't require an ongoing supply of oxygen. Anaerobic pathways can provide ATP immediately, but they also have limited stores that need to be refilled after they are used up.

ATP is created in essentially two ways. One is by aerobic metabolism using oxygen carried in the bloodstream. This is a sure and steady way to create virtually unlimited sources of energy; however, it has a limit on how fast it can work.

During intense power exercise, such as fast 100 metres sprinting or lifting heavy weights, muscles rely on anaerobic metabolism, which can only produce a certain amount of energy at a time, unlike the aerobic metabolism system, which can produce energy over hours like for a marathon runner .

Trained marathon runners have a greater ability to quickly deliver oxygen to the working muscles which increases the ability to use aerobic metabolism at a higher exercise intensity. 

Lactic acid is a product of anaerobic energy production. When you work out, you stress the fibers in your muscles, causing them to break down. As these muscle fibers break down, your body responds by processing the by-products of intense muscular exertion (a complex chemical and mitochondrial process), which is also referred to as muscular acidosis, or lactic acid build up in the muscle tissue. 

This process is accompanied by an aching soreness, varying from mild discomfort to serious pain. You will most likely feel the most soreness (related to your body processing the lactic acid buildup in your recovering muscle fibers) the second and third day after an intense workout.

Vitamin C and potassium a Both nutrients are also believed to speed the recovery and repair the stressed muscle fibers. Vitamin C can be found in citrus juice and supplements. Potassium is found in bananas and kiwi. 

By drinking plenty of water, you can flush your body of excess lactic acid. When you take the time to stretch after exercising, you allow the muscles to release some of the lactic acid building up in the muscles. After several workouts, you’ll find your muscles suffer less and less from pain related to lactic acid build up. This is because the muscles adapt to the strain placed upon them.

Pain is a warning mechanism the threat of injury, to bodily tissues. 

Large bulging muscles of wrestler is a good example of cellular adaptation The normal muscle cell might have 2,000 myofilaments, the hypertrophied cell might have 4,000 myofilaments. The workload can now be divided evenly among twice as many myofilaments, and the muscle cell is capable of more work. 

The new cells are more robust than their fragile cousins. The individual can do wrestling without excessive fatigue, and no cell injury results from the hard session. A new level of equilibrium has been achieved by the process of cellular hypertrophy. A wrestler with this type of muscular development can be considered to be in excellent physical condition.

A large part of the loss of muscle mass with age is the result of disuse and atrophy rather than loss of muscle fibres. Muscles which are not used shrink at an alarming rate— disuse atrophy.

The greatest myth propagated by sport coaches is that lactic acid is the cause of the stiffness felt after an event such as a marathon. Stiffness is caused mostly to damage to the muscle, and not an accumulation of lactic acid or lactic acid crystals in the muscle. Lactic acid does not exist as an acid in the body: it exists in another form called “lactate”, and it is this that is actually measured in the blood when “lactic acid” concentration is determined. 

Another misconception is that lactate is responsible for acidifying the blood, thereby causing fatigue. To the contrary, lactate is actually an important fuel that is used by the muscles during prolonged exercise. Lactate released from the muscle is converted in the liver to glucose, which is then used as an energy source. So rather than cause fatigue, it actually helps to delay a possible lowering of blood glucose concentration, a condition called hypoglycemia, and which will cause a runner to feel weak and fatigued if it occurs.

Muscle cells convert glucose or glycogen to lactic acid. Then lactic acid is absorbed converted to a fuel by mitochondria in muscle cells.

By training at a high intensity (lactate threshold training) the body creates additional proteins that help absorb and convert lactic acid to energy. Thus when muscle is rebuild after a power isometric workout , the secreted hormone builds the muscles by redirecting fat from the abdomen area of men – butt for women.

A kilo of waste fat requires 7000 calories. 300 calories is burnt in one hour of brisk walking. ( it is K calories !)

By sipping ice cold water every 20 minutes during the day you provide a clear repeated signal to your metabolism to keep your energy and alertness levels higher. When ice water reaches the stomach it stimulates increased energy production though out the body and raise alertness. It also causes loss of excess body fat. One way to FOOL YOUR METABOLISM.

Hypertension is a drought management system of the body , where reverse osmosis takes place to refill the cells with water. Doctors do the reverse — they happily prescribe diuretics. 

Think about it!

NOBEL PRIZE VALUE -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL








My son has chosen Cornell university among 11, who have given him an acceptance letter for his ME in Computer Science. 

One of the major factors affecting his choice is that as of 2009 , there are 42 Nobel laureates affiliated to Ivy league university Cornell.

So-- What is the worth of a NOBEL PRIZE?

Mahatma Gandhi was nominated 5 times for peace , but never got it. Later Nobel commitee clarified that Gandhi died and they do not believe in posthumous awards. But they developed amnesia and gave a posthumous award to Dag Hammarskjold. 


When Gandhi went to London to see the queen , he was told that he was not sufficiently dressed--to which he remarked that the queen would be wearing enough clothes for both.

Henry Kissinger got it for peace , despite being a war monger-- joint prize winner Le Duc Tho refused to dishonour himself and declined the joint peace prize .

Nikola Tesla could not get it-- for lighting up the world, for he was eastern orthodox Serbian, and Edison used money power and media against him. Marconi got it after stealing Tesla's work.

Mark Twain was ignored , probably because he was too friendly with Nikola Tesla.

Rabindranath Tagore gets it for penning our national anthem Jana Gana Mana --written solely to welcome King George to India -- though art the dispenser of our destiny -- blah blah--

Opportunist Mother Theresa who hardly dirtied her hands got it for opening 500 convents worldwide-- yes she was there with dirty hands , in all photo shoots done by the white man.

And how about this-- Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo wins the 2010 Nobel Prize--and the kisses of the west.

Menachem Begin , a mass murderer on whose head Britain had a bounty of 10000 pounds when he was head of the terrorist group Irgun in 1948, got it for peace!  Imagine Osama Bin Laden receiving a Nobel peace prize !!-- just because the top superpowers are Muslim.

Al Gore gets it for giving bull about meteorology-- ( he did terrific self marketing by making sure all international flights played his findings on DVD ).  We all know the effect of HAARP on the ionosphere and subsequent global warming.

Dimitri Mendeleyev could not get it for his fantastic Chemical periodic table-- just because he gave Sanskrit names to a few elements --out of courtesy to Panini.

22% of all Nobel prizes giev has been bestowed on Jews. 181 Jews to be exact.  This is bizarre as the world Jewish polulation is just 0.02%.  

Only 3 Muslims have got the Nobel prize so far. 

Shows the hold of Rothschild and Zionists in this arena.


WHAT A DISGRACE!

Here is a 7000 year old Vedic chant--Grace and peace!

COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE MILLING MOB-- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL



Myself and my wife had gone for the AR Rahman ( genius who can thrash Hans Zimmer on the keyboard , and Oscar award winner ) concert at Calicut last year. 

I took an expensive row to avoid injury to my wife just in case there was a stampede-- with lot of bomb scares going around India around that time.

The concert was delayed , and the crowd in the huge gallery section started milling out of disappointment and dashed expectations. Just like how cattle behave just before a stampede. 

The milling of an stadium audience is usually the signal that customary rules of courtesy toward performers are no longer applicable and that different forms of behaviour may be expected. There always lie within us certain antagonistic attitudes. Our ego is constructed out of this matrix of aggressiveness and superiority of our own group.

This section was mostly made of emotional college students. They were now about to release the inhibitions of attitudes that had been censored. 

Since milling behavior study was one of my per hobbies , i was observing closely and taking videos using my N95.

The crowd on the gallery ( about 30000 people ) soon became a mob due to the frustration of delay. Soon i could notice the internal rapport or collective hypnosis, where an individual loses self control and responds only to the dictates of the crowd. THIS IS THE STATE WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL IS ABSORBED INTO THE CROWD AND CONTROLLED BY THE CROWD MIND.. The air of menace had emerged from the crowd, and the basest of human impulses were soon to be expressed-- “herd instincts” and “the group mind” 

As the police looked on nervously -- suddenly without warning -- a Mexican wave started anti-clockwise. 

We all were lucky that this expressive behavior was constructive.

The frenzy of the crowd became contagious, and the contagion fed upon itself like a typhoon, growing -- and soon they had the perfect mexican wave with all IN THE WAVE holding up their lighted up mobile phones in the twilight.

--and then suddenly-- 

-- surprise --

another perfect mexican wave started reverse , clockwise -- with more noise and frenzy. 

The students being intelligent pulled this of with great panache--

i don't think i will ever get to see a more exhilarating sight. Two opposing human waves with sound and light becoming one and then separating swiftly-- again and again--

i was overcome with a sense of euphoria due to the crowd emotion and motion-

it was a sight for the gods --

--whereby a huge crowd fell under the influence of a collective mind and provided a wonderful atmosphere--and burnt their nervous energy out.

 The element of spontaneity, is always a crucial component of collective behavior.

WHEN A CROWD TUNS INTO A MOB -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL



 





This is an extension of my previous blog, where a restless milling mob of 30000 souls showed CONSTRUCTIVE behavior-- and produced awesome opposing Mexican waves---

What follows is my observations when i put myself inside a milling mob-- to get the feel, and also from outside--

Once in Pusan Korea , watching the milling from outside gave me the shivers and i beat a hasty retreat-- what with bandannas and warpaint being put on, the swagger,  gasoline jerry cans popping out to make Molotov cocktails to the beat of drums-- and a armed to the teeth riot police waiting nearby--

Riots and public lynchings being commonplace in India, mob psychology can be predicted easily.

I have seen in Australia,  police showing preferential treatment when the berserk drunken mob chasing Lebanese on the beachfront  is made of English speaking whites. Another set of standards are shown for students of  coloured Indian race who protest peacefully against racist violence , by pinning them down without escape routes--and not allowing them a voice. 

In the Jallianwala bagh massacre , the British had sealed off all escape routes before gunning down 1500 unarmed and peaceful people ( 10% of the crowd including women and children ) who were holding a meeting.

Ego laden Capt Bligh of Mutiny on the County fame could not see the signs of milling with a thousand natives beating rocks held in both hands together in unison on the beach -- causing painful loss of life .

here we go--


A crowd is not a mob but it can become one, in a jiffy — that all crowds can transform into law breaking mobs , is the core of mob sociology.  A crowd is law abiding, while a mob is not.

A crowd turns into a destructive mob only due to one factor-- ANONYMITY.

This makes them feel that they can beat up anybody or burn property. This is called mob mentality.  


De individualisation leads to strange lowering of intellectual faculties and bizzare de-rationalisation. The individual is absorbed into the crowd and is now controlled by the singular mob mind. 


In society there always exists an undercurrent of anger towards the establishment for unfair treatment, with no effective way to deal with the situation. Our conventions of manners have taught us to react politely even to people whom we distrust and dislike. 





There is a perception that a crisis is required to achieve long denied aspirations, and that all legitimate channels of achieving this are blocked deliberately..


Once  the fuel has accumulated , any spark can set it off.  The self importance of the individual , suddenly far exceeds his own mundane social life standing. Delusions of grandeur and self righteousness prevails.


An actual incident isn’t required— just a rumor ( like an attempted assassination attempt ) can spread through a group and turn deep-seeded anger  into a violent outburst. 


Riots which are set off due to soccer sports teams losing , is due to disappointment and release of pent up frustrations by hitting slow passing cars etc -- while if it is due to team winning, it is always alcohol related and a victory celebration. 


It is important that the police know the basics of crowd management-- it is NOT about charging in like storm troopers and beating all the so called enemies to bone crunching submission or putting them behind bars.  


Faced with the prospect of arrest 99% people just want to home home. 


All that is required is for the uniformed police to intimidate by beating their batons on their shields, or even taking photographs of the crowd, to knock off the CLOAK OF ANONYMITY-- so that feelings of selfconsiousness are not erased.  


It may be critical to arrest the ring leaders.  


It is crucial to cordon off the area, to prevent more people from coming in--but an escape route must be provided for the mob caught  inside, lest in panic they trample each other.  


There are many who look for that ecstatic experience of outlandish behavior, for release from dreary routine , removal of inhibitions , partisanship and to dominate those whom they don't like but dare not attack alone. 


The sole aim of the police is to transform the mob back into into a crowd, and give them time to dissipate their emotions or burn itself out. 


Once a single riot is full blown it can spread to hundreds of cities like what happened when Indira Gandhi was gunned down-- this is called scapegoating.. 3000 innocent patriotic Sikhs were butchered overnight.


When someone violates good citizenship, it must be nipped in the bud on the spot , el pronto -- for inaction will ALWAYS mushroom unacceptable disruptive behavior.

A MARRIAGE SANS FIGHTS -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL




Sometimes I wonder why my 28 years of marriage has gone smoothly without a single fight.


   
Especially when yours truly is a super strong character, who does not take anything lying down.

One of the factors definitely is -- that i went for an arranged marriage. 

Of course we saw each other and gave our consent. Our parents gauged our compatibility. Our horoscopes were matched to see if the most intelligent force blessed the union.

Being a handsome young sailor i had my share of opportunities for a love marriage -- but i knew that love marriages do NOT work. 

I wanted a girl who could blush, for the blush is the most powerful charm of a girl's beauty. And is not a blush the color of virtue?

I was acutely aware of the worry and strain of the Western marriage concept where sex plays a major role. When the feelings wane we all know what is in store. 

The western marraige is based on lust and feelings , the Eastern on TRUST  honour and committment.  An Indian woman does NOT go for silicon implants to SAVE her marriage.

An arranged marriage is a compromise. It is a 51:49 relationship.

When a cup of tea has to be made there is no doubt who is gonna make it.  When it comes to security of the family there is no doubt who will provide that. 

In India the divorce rate is less than 1% while in the west it is greater than 50%.

Wrigley's chewing gum and perfumes are a must before a western date-- for the boy and girl must taste their mutual fruits -- before saying YES.

In the Eastern concept the boy gets to taste the fruits , only after the ceremony. It is an exciting period of discovery. Love will follow.

On the GRAPH of love versus time-- on X / Y axis, a love marriage starts at zero time ( wedding night ) on the horizontal axis and 100% love on the vertical axis.

What is already on top cannot go up any more--remember you had been  surviving on love and fresh air and showing only your best behavior and profile to each other , hiding all your warts,  BO with perfume and MO with Wrigleys.

Within two months the index falls like an asymptotic curve.



Everything in life is relative. In one , the index keeps falling , while in the other it has to rise.

For what was this love--just an arrangement of convenience.



If you were staying in Mumbai you fall in love with a girl from Mumbai--if you were in Timbuctoo you fall in love with a girl from there. True love knows no barriers of race, religion or age.

My arranged marriage  started with the index on zero love at zero time. What is already at rock bottom cannot fall any further. It can only go up.  Ego does not play a huge role.

Marriage is an institution which must be respected.



I remember when my crew was Jamaican , and if they did something extraordinary , like winning a race at the Flying Angels athletic meet --

I would pose a question. " Brown , whom did you run for" .

Pat comes the answer " I ran for Maaamma " .

Naturally-- Brown did NOT run for Paaapa because his mother never married,-- she just lived in with lot of men.

digression:--

However here is my self proclaimed answer to the first question --the first line of this piece. At our honeymoon hotel , they had a package for honeymoon couples. There were 12 newly weds in a nice luxury coach.

Our first stop was the Ooty lake. All the eleven couples went for the foot paddle boats. I went for the rowing wooden boat with the heavy oars-- declined the services of a professional rower, and shot off to the other end of the huge lake like an arrow.

Very soon i could see 11 envious ladies cajoling their husbands to be more  romantic ( like me ) and row serenade them ,  instead of forcing them to use their delicate leg power.

 So we had 12 rowing boats in the lake -- pretty soon--with NO professional rowers in them.

Out of these 12 , 11 got stuck in the slush with the grooms unable to row further due to enervated tendons  fatigued muscles and blistered palms -- triggering off a huge rescue operation which took two hours, in front of a huge sniggering crowd.-- what with so much of smeared lipsticks and smudged mascaras--

All 11 genteel brides had panicked and were in tears--some of them wailing loudly.

All 11 grooms gave me dirty looks, for spoiling their party --  Their brides were giving me side glances of admiration.

I could see that my wife was proud of me , for she started holding mE hand -- and she had reprogrammed her DNA to respect me for ever  HA!  ;-).

Below : This picture was taken immediately after the lake rowing incident- my nostrils are dilated and I am sweating and breathing hard - 




PSSST, secret --  Why should i tell her than i was a champion team rower of whaler and cutters while in our Training ship which had 250 cadets . We practised almost daily for 2 years. I used to be the bowman , who had 1:6 ratio on the crutch pivot while the rest of the team had 1:3 ( boat is narrow at the bows )

--and my rowing tendons, were seasoned and tough -- like steel wires..

TEEE--HEEEEEE !

BODY LANGUAGE SECRETS -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL





i knew of an accountant who had 12 females in his department--all of whom were in LOVE with him--but the poor guy never knew it--

so what are the signs emitted by a female who is interested in a male ?--
     

           
body language is an outward reflection of her emotional condition-- it can't lie--like words! when words and body language are in conflict--ignore 'em words-- and secret-- when women lie they always appear to be damn busy--



           

signals like pupil dilation ( opposite is beady eyes , which show NIL love interest ) --



  --and blushing can never be wrong -- by the way a blush is the most powerful charm of a woman's beauty--
       
---and basis body language signs are the same all over the world-- which i have been sailin' around for 3.5 decades--
      

                     

as soon as she sees you the first time , and she fancies you-- she will give that SIDEWAYS look , a second longer than necessary-- the eyes of a woman always smile at a man she is attracted to-



       

she could put her face on the backside of both her open palms-- with her elbows on the table-- inner wrists exposed-- and her eyebrows will flash a wee bit--



       

if she managed to hold your glance for an extended gaze of 4 seconds --and then looked down , she will soon enough bite her lower lips to make them red --like how the female rhesus monkey makes its ass red -- ( oops! i am NOT supposed to support darwin--for according to him, the evolution stopped after humans, i wish he lived longer to hear about quantum physics )  



       

she will look at your footwear to check out if they are elegant or bumpkin type--

and then--



   

IF SHE YAWNS --IT MEANS THAT SHE HAS FALLEN IN LOVE AT FIRST GLANCE ( i hold the intellectual rights for this , ok? ). Love yawns release huge waves of energy from the heart.

--it is basically a yearnin' sigh! big waves of energy emanates from her heart!!



       

and, she will be watching you using her peripheral vision--
     
lucky you!!

HISTORY RE INVENTED-- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL




--- about history getting fudged--

when hitler invaded austria / czech and precipitated the 2nd world war-- the english speaking anglo-saxon cried WOLF -- what was he doing? he was sitting on 60% of the world, including india -- eyeing the remaining 40% like how a spider eyes the fly! what happened to all the red indians of usa and aborginies of australia? who started slavery ?

when britain left india in 1947-- the power of a nuclear submarine was well known -- whoever controls the BLUE INDIAN OCEAN controls the world- - the communists of china and russia , could get into the central all weather ocean from either side of the himalayas -- the americans put two islamic buffers there-- west pakistan and east pakistan ( bangla-desh )- - islam and communism are like oil and water-- ideology does not mix--

TODAY THE SAME ISLAMIC BUFFER IS GIVING A HUGE PROBLEM TO THEM --

vasco-da-gama reached CALICUT ( my home town ) in 1498-- and discovered india -- our palace records say something else -- vasco-da-gama was hopelessly lost in malindi ( kenya )-- he was piloted across by the
calicut king's ( zamorin ) deep sea pilot ibn aziz-- ibn aziz saw some strange white men on the principal street of malindi and wanted to know where they were from--11 years before that a spanish ship had come to india--one local kerala beach is named after that spanish captain -- i guess he forgot to send the all important ARRIVAL FAX.

our calicut kings had deep sea pilots who went all the way aqaba and jerusalem hundreds of years before christ-- this is how doubting thomas came after christs death to india, by ship--

the hero of israel-- king solomon ( of david fame ). his offical seal is etched in my vernacular mother tongue MALAYALAM-- probably his wife sheba made him do this. you can see a photograph of this kings official
seal in madame blavatsky's book.

-- and mother theresa-- they have canonised her-- who was she ?

4 feet nothing-- had a beard-- ugly like ughhh -- ran away from impoverished albania -- was sent to india as she was uneducated, knew no english --

 -- she did her act well -- used her white skin to advantage -- she got herself all the publicity -- she was the queen bee of her kingdom --

when a white man from a magazine came for a photoshoot, she would fondle lepers and cuddle babies-- just like how politicians do before elections--

-- there were thousands who did more than her -- but never cared for publicity or photographs --

-- true philanthropists shun publicity--

pray, what were her options in life-- could she have got married? could she have got a decent job? WAS SHE PRINCESS DIANA OR ANJELINA JOLIE?

EDUCATION IS SELF DISCOVERY OF OWN IGNORANCE.
When the western countries, came out from the quaternary ice age in 9500 BC, and were staying in caves, eating raw meat and doing grunt grunt, India was a great civilization, with kings staying in palaces, wearing silk and writing poetry in Sanskrit. An employee German Max Mueller working for German Jews Rothschild, the owner of opium running British East India company, was told by Vatican to subvert world history to prove to all, that Bible dates are right. That the big bang of cosmos happened in 23rd Oct 4004 BC, 9 AM ( while it happened 14 billion years ago ) and that the great flood with Noah’s arc and party happened in 2500 BC ( life came on earth 4 billion years ago ) . BY 5000 BC, the Indian Rig Veda was written in Sanskrit. Every religion and prayer on this planet is an offshoot of Hinduism and every language is an offshoot of Sanskrit. The Aryans went out of India, with their Swastika symbol ( inscribed on Shiva's son Ganesha's palm ) as modern DNA tests have proved, never into India, as contended by Hitler . The Indian Dravidian Anahata Chakra 6 point star has been adopted by Jewish religion. Shiva Lingam stones of ex-pagan temples are the main attraction at Mecca Kaaba , Dome of the rock at Jerusalem and Vatican.

HIBERNATION WITH HYDROGEN SULPHIDE GAS -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL







On one of my chemical tankers , I had a severe emergency.

My chief officer, 2nd Engineer , Fitter and Deck cadet fell unconscious in a stainless steel cargo tank having Stearic acid at 70 deg C, and padded with Nitrogen to reduce oxygen content to less than 1% of oxygen by volume.

To cut a long story short, we got 3 of them , on the top platform of the tank ladder , out in a jiffy and got them back on their feet by CPR and oxygen.

But the 2nd Engineer had slid down to the 2nd platform and was just inches off the hot chemical surface. It took us 23 minutes to get him out and revive him.

He came out cold , with No breathing and pulse , with a gaping cut on his eyebrow showing no bleeding. As a last resort I had held on to overhead pipes and used my feet on his torso from behind using my body weight –in a type of Shaffer's style . The moment he started breathing we hooked on pure oxygen .

Since that incident he got promoted twice with NIL signs of brain damage.

I would like to believe that went into a state of HIBERNATION or suspended animation or state of hypothermia -- triggered by some H2S gas just on top of the Palm oil derivative.

My Russian Chief Engineer whose home was in the Ural mountains with plenty of bears would talk about how the bears love to bury freshly killed meat and wait till the carcass rotted before they would eat it, in the beginning of winter . I guess the whole thing is about Hydrogen Suphide which propels them into hibernation.
Hydrogen sulfide is something all of us make in our bodies all the time to buffer our metabolic flexibility—It is what makes our body core temperature to stay at 98.7 degrees F, regardless of whether we're in Siberia or Congo. 

Same way H2S is used by warm blooded animals, like bears that go into hibernation as a way of reducing body temperature . 


The body temperature of a hibernating bear will drop from its usual 100 degrees F to 88 degrees F. The bear's heart will slow from 90 beats a minute down to 25  beats . Instead of its usual 18  breaths per minute, a hibernating bear will take one deep breath every 45 seconds. Electrical activity inside a hibernating  brain indicates  a 90 percent reduction .

The bear is  balanced on a very narrow line between the maintenance of life at a level that makes recovery from hibernation possible and a reduction of metabolism to a level that will lead to death. Hibernation is entered into from a state of sleep.. Hibernation and sleep are somewhat similar in that essential body processes continue during both periods , though at a lowered level. . Exposed to food shortages, extremely low temperatures, the bear just turns off  its thermostat and hibernates until the environment becomes more favourable.  Lot of calories is requires to convert into heat and survive icy conditions.



Hydrogen sulfide is similar to oxygen at the molecular level because it binds at many of the same proteins. As a result, H2S competes for and interferes with the body's ability to use oxygen for energy production -- a process within the cell's power-generating machinery called oxidative phosphorylation. During a hibernation-like state, cellular activity slows to a near standstill, which reduces dramatically the animals’ need for oxygen.

Hibernating animals conserve energy, during winter when food is short, tapping energy reserves, body fat, at a slow rate. It is the animal's slowed metabolic rate which leads to a reduction in body temperature and not the other way around.

As hibernation drastically reduces the amount of oxygen that cells need to survive It could be used to buy time when treating severe blood loss for wounded soldiers , hypothermia in freezing seas ,  heart attacks and strokes, in which oxygen deprivation kills off tissue, leading to disability or death.

David Blaine was submerged in a water-filled sphere on the stage of “The Oprah Winfrey Show” during a live broadcast, and he  held his breath for 17 minutes and 4 seconds—for a new  Guinness World Record. It is reported that Blaine inhaled pure oxygen for 23 minutes before the feat.

WELL—I CAN SAY THAT HE WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER IF HE BREATHED IN HYDROGEN SULPHIDE BEFORE THE FEAT AND USED OXYGEN AFTER WARDS TO REVIVE HIMSELF. 


In extreme doses, hydrogen sulfide can bind to cells in place of oxygen, thus shutting down metabolism.

Hibernator animals have like bears have significant depots of brown fat in several anatomical locations (most notably between the shoulder blades), humans have very insignificant stores of this specialized tissue. We can only generate significant amounts of heat by muscle activity, i. e., shivering.  So not only in terms of our internal thermostat but also anatomically, we humans are ill-equipped to hibernate. In technical terms, we are incapable of “non-shivering thermogenesis”. 

The large amounts of fatty tissue in overweight people are useless for hibernation,  as this “yellow” adipose tissue is unable to generate heat.  Otherwise we could loose weight simply by turning down the heating during winter or taking a walk in the cold with inadequate clothing. 

To travel to far off planets , astronauts may have to be in suspended animation to cut off unwieldy consumables - food and water - on a journey that could take years .  During hibernation, black bears rarely urinate or defecate. Virtually all metabolic waste is reused, including excess calcium, which is refashioned into new bone.





Some cancer treatments work by denying oxygen to malignant cells. But the approach can also harm nearby healthy cells. If the oxygen needs of healthy cells could be reduced through suspended animation, then cancer medicines could be used longer, with greater effect.


Hydrogen sulfide treatment might improve the safety of surgery operations, such as coronary artery-bypass  that can temporarily reduce oxygen supply to the heart and brain.


I am claiming the PATENT to this hibenation post - 


Like H2S , Nitric Oxide is a bio signaller--as written in the Indian Vedas 7000 years ago. 

This is why our King Mantra OM --has the humming function to trigger production of the Nitric oxide molecule.  

Both H2S and NO relaxes blood vessels-- and the miracle part is that they share the job, in a QUID PRO QUO manner, and a Tamas-Rajas (Yin-Yang..) manner.

GAMMA BRAIN WAVES -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL










IN THE GAMMA STATE YOU ARE AWARE OF YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS. THEY ARE THE BRAINWAVES OF A PSYCHIC IN A TRANCE.


When you are under anesthesia, the Gamma brain waves stop.  Obtaining a stress-free gamma state is perhaps one of the GREATEST FEELINGS imaginable

If i suddenly put a King Cobra in your room , as soon as you see it, you will experience intense fear --your brain will jump into the Gamma range ( >40 Hz on EEG  ) for a very brief time . The mind is extremely focused on just one thought while in the gamma brainwave range.

Gamma Brainwaves are associated with the brain function which creates a holographic synthesis of data stored in various areas of the brain to fuse them together into a higher perspective. The Gamma state fosters intuition and creativity.

When i wrote the Chemical Handbook for my company--i used to be in the Gamma brainwave state for about 8 hours a day--- in a state of crystal-clear mental lucidity and great focus . It is a state of peak performance.

Gamma brainwaves have a frequency of over 40 Hz (40 pulses per second). This EEG frequency registers during problem solving.  Gamma brainwaves are associated with high-level information processing in the brain.

Gamma waves are associated with enhanced perception and a high level of consciousness. There happens a binding of your senses . The gamma brainwave is what allows you to experience, smell, touch, vision, taste, and hearing altogether.

Your brain is able to operate more efficiently at a higher level. Thoughts are easily processed and the brain is able to easily absorb and understand new information and changes in one’s environment.

The gamma brainwave is a natural antidepressant and it boosts your overall levels of happiness.

People with high amounts of gamma brainwaves have a advanced learning abilities.

The gamma brainwave has been associated with higher than average levels of intelligence. People with lower I.Q.’s and learning disabilities cannot have gamma brainwaves.

Gamma brainwave activity is present in Rapid-Eye Movement (R.E.M.) Sleep .



Observing a thought not only makes you aware of the thought but it also makes you conscious of yourself as a witness to the thought. 

A new dimension of consciousness has stepped in, the habitual, compulsive thoughts have lost their power and will gradually subside. 

As you learn to go into the high Gamma state, you decide when to think, and in the empty spaces between the thoughts, you will feel an inner peace and calmness. This is not a state of trance - there is no loss of consciousness here. 

On the contrary you are much more awake, aware and present, than in the state where you identify with your thoughts.

In the high Gamma state with no thoughts, you become conscious of your own being-- of your own true nature.  

In this sublime state you will realize that all that really matters such as beauty, freedom, love, creativity, joy and inner peace,--  is found beyond thoughts.

Gamma is the harmonizing frequency - for example when you are observing an object, its colour, size, texture etc are all perceived and processed by different parts of the brain, Gamma allows for unification of all the different information.

Beyond Gamma you have HyperGamma, Lambda and Epsilon frequencies.

They are linked together in a circular relationship -where if you looked with a magnifying glass at an extremely slow Epsilon brain frequency, you would see hidden within it a modulation frequency of 100 - 200 Hz.  

If you stand back far enough from an extremely fast 200 Hz brainwave frequency, you would see that is it riding on the crest of a slow motion modulating wave of Epsilon.

This Epsilon state of consciousness (the state Yogi's go into when they achieve "suspended animation") is where western medical doctors can perceive no heart beat, respiration or pulse.


The vedic civilisation flourished from 9000 BC to 4000 BC on the banks of the river Saraswati, till the river dried up due to an earthquake blocking the glacial mouth at the Himalayas. These seers had 12 strand DNA and king sized resonating pineal glands.Yoga was born on the banks of the river Saraswati.



HyperGamma and Lambda states of consciousness are the states associated with the ability of certain sects of Tibetan monks who can mediate in the Himalayan mountains in sub-zero temperatures with scanty clothing and melt the snow all around them.

PSYCHICS , MEDIUMS , HEALERS AND REIKI CHANNELS -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL











A psychic  has the powers to detect the invisible universe , to foresee events in the future or to contact spirits. They have 6th sense, esp, inner sight or intuition. 

The psychic ( unlike a schizophrenic ) has a clear boundary between the real physical world and the invisible world.  In USA they employ psychics for police and military work.

Hypnosis invented by James Braid  ( 1795—1860),  he was the first in the western world to re-invent the ancient Indian Vedic  theory of mind over matter ( psychokinesis ) . He showed that the power of suggestion could have an extraordinary effect on body.

Aether ( akasha ) is the source of all intelligence in the universe. It makes up the force field.  It is the life force that sustains all the atoms and molecules in the universe. 


We hardly ever think of the empty space where the electrons buzz around.  99.999% of the atom is empty space. Electrons pelt around the nucleus at tremendous speeds , without slowing down because they tap into quantum fluctuations in empty space -- i remember asking my physics teacher about this , when i was 13 years old-- and he got upset with me.

When you die the soul lives on in a afterlife in the higher planes. We sense the visible universe with our 5 human senses. The invisible universe is outside these 5 senses. We must use ESP to perceive aspects of this vast invisible universe. Not every psychic is a medium.  A medium is someone who can contact and receive messages from the spirit world.

Everything in the physical world that appears to be static is in fact made of of vibrating particles. The soul or spirit which inhabit the higher dimensions of the universe vibrates at higher frequencies that are faster than the speed of light.  We can communicate with them only through ESP .

Akashic record—every thing that has ever happened in the universe is held in a vast library of the cosmic memory.  Anyone who can tune in can access this memory bank.

When you look at a person you see only his physical body.  A psychic can see 7 extra  layers or auras surrounding it.  Each aura is a higher vibration or frequency. These bodies interlink and are as real as your physical body. If they are healthy , you will be healthy. If they are unhealthy you will have mental, spiritual, emotional or physical imbalance. Each aura has a link to a different plane in the universe.

A psychic reading the auras at this level may pick up thoughts that are not conscious to the person being read but that are unconsciously influencing his behavior.

When reading the higher auras of the body. Psychics can pick up messages about future events that will impact the person being read. This is because on a etheric level, events in the future already exist.

The feeling of being pushed or pulled by fate is also the influence of the higher cosmic forces.

The 3 higher spiritual auras are the seat of the higher self. The higher self or super conscious is our personal link between visible and invisible universe.  It communicates and interrelates with higher cosmic consciousness.

The higher self transmits messages to the subconscious mind in the form of dreams, intuition and psychic insight. The subconscious then communicates these to your conscious mind through images, thoughts and feelings. Dreams are symbolic and need interpretation.

The auras contain seven chakras . The crown chakra is the point of access to the spiritual universe. The Chakras are traditionally considered the "nervous system" of the metaphysical body, since it is through them that life energies are received, processed, and transmitted, and through them that body, mind, and spirit are linked together into one holistic system. The energy-information frequencies found in the Aura are identical to those found in the Chakra channels

The chakras are connected to each other through etheric channels. Physical, emotional, mental and spiritual ailments can be correlated with energy blocks or dysfunctions within the chakras. Balancing the chakra through psychic healing allows the appropriate flow of energy to a chakra to reestablish health on each level.

Logical left brain thinking is held in high esteem by the western society.you can overturn this and pay attention to your hunches and grow your clairvoyance.

The spirit world exists in a dimension of higher vibration. A medium forms a link or channel , a route of communication with those who have passed to the other side. He does so by raising his vibration or frequency to a point where the link can be formed. As this same time the spirits lower their vibration.  They communicate the energies through pictures , feelings, sounds and thoughts.  The medium interprets these through his broadened sense bands.

The universe cannot distinguish between a positive and negative thought.  A negative thought will bring a negative manifestation towards you. Karma is the law of cause and effect.

When you use psychic power you tap into the level of the universe, where individuality does not exist. At this level each of us is a part of a universal and cosmic consciousness where we are connected as though held together by invisible threads. This interconnectedness means that every thing we do or think affects everything and everyone else. A black magician uses this knowledge to send negative thoughts that will harm another person.

Everything is made out of energy. What appears to be solid is made up of vibrating particles, atoms and molecules. This includes human beings. According to psychic theory all the beings that live in the universe are made up of vibrating energies. The higher and faster the frequency, the higher the plane of the universe. 

Psychic development will teach you how to raise your vibration or lower it at will.

Time and space are features in the material world , not the invisible world.  There the present past and future are all occurring right now. This means when you contact the higher realms you can tap into past lives or the future.

By learning to project your will and change your vibration through altering the state of your consciousness , you will begin to develop psychic powers.

All psychic exercises require you to alter your state of consciousness to reach ALPHA ( 7  Hz )  state. It is a light trance state achieved by meditation. Your breathing slows down, you cease to notice noise, and visual distractions.  You must be in the NOW.

Self hypnosis is a form of meditation in which the mind is stilled to reach an altered state of consciousness. Chanting and certain music ( classical ) can raise your vibration and help you to meditate.



Gold colour can balance disturbed energy. Indian did not start wearing gold , quartz and diamonds  for sheer investment.

Dark spots in the aura may indicate illness. Aura’s energy-information can be used to accurately analyze a patient’s psychological and emotional states. Each part and level of the human Aura is related to different aspects of the person's psychology or physical health, and reveals an interaction of both physical and mental factors. 

When you touch something you implant your psychic imprint on it like a magnetic recording on a tape. By holding the object and tuning in through your ESP you can pick up these subtle vibrations. Be careful of inherited jewellery especially if it contains gem stones and crystals, which pick up magnetic imprints very easily.

Every building has its own energy. Having ill, mentally unstable or negative people in a home can leave a residual energy in the building. As the physical structure like furniture picks up vibrations, because of the emotion that has accompanied events there. Eastern cultures wont pick up second hand objects because they are afraid of attracting another persons karma.

Changes in hormones and strong emotions inside a child physical body creates an outward charge that attracts the negative spirit. Animals are more attuned to higher frequencies and are sensitive to presence of spirits.

A spiritual healer acts as a channel for universal WHITE light or god energy from the spirit world to the patient. A healer is only a medium—or a bridge between two worlds. If he closes down the channel he has no innate ability. Healers generate electrical voltages >60 V during healing sessions --as measured by electrometers.

Russian inventor Semyon Davidovich Kirlian,  experimented with the qualities and meanings of Auras using photography and electrofield imaging. 







The British doctor Walter J. Kilner, invented a series of goggles and filters through which anyone can see Auras in detail.  EEG (electroencephalogram) technology analyses and monitors mental activity entirely by electromagnetic principles.  Science also has the  electrocardiogram (EKG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the electromyogram (EMG).

We exist in a sea of various EM waves that are continuously interacting and interfering with each other. Living beings transmit EM waves with numerous frequencies and strengths, and these interact with EM waves traveling throughout our environments that have multiple frequencies and strengths. 


The practical result is a “boundary layer” of interaction between the person and the environment, in which waves are constructively and destructively interfering to various degrees, until  RESONANCE is achieved, causing an amplification of the vibrations  much the same way that constructive interference occurs with waves. 


The result can be that the increase in vibration reduces the object’s structural stability – hence, the breaking of a glass when a soprano singer hits a high enough note to match the fundamental frequency or a harmonic frequency of the glass.

Psychic ability is the natural extension of intuition. Aura is a magnetic energy and is a protective shield.`. All thoughts , emotions and feelings are contained in the aura and sent out to the universe. All 7 chakras have their own frequencies of resonant vibration. Clairsentient people are sensitive to energy.

All have psychic power- but it remains repressed. The ordinary man ignores his intuition in favour of commonsense—and so in the course of time untuition stops manifesting clearly. The psychic is a supersensitive soul. He can figure out the nuances of intuition. For him intuition works at his beck and call in a clear way.. he does not need to go into a trance or even meditate. He will answer all your questions effortlessly. A true psychic's intuition can spot falsehood immediately.  His intuition ecompasses space and time.

A healer may lay his hands on a patient, or hold his hands at a slight distance from the body, within the aura. By doing this he can sense areas where energy is needed and the nature of the illness. Next he directs energy to the patient. An illness is often the result of an imbalance within other auras. Psychic healing takes place on a mind spirit and body level. The energy is directed to restore the balance at subtle levels.




Reiki originated in India and soon became a dead science . Dr Usui --the re-inventor of Reiki channeled a number of symbols that allowed him to tap into the universal life force. Reiki taps into universal energy to treat the whole person—mind, body, emotions and spirit. 


Reiki is not dependant on a individuals level of spiritual or psychic development. It uses 6 specific hand positions on a persons body to undo blocks thast cause pain or illness and allow the life force to flow freely once more. Water treated by Reiki healers become more alkaline, due to decreased hydrogen bonding between the molecules. A healer is just a conduit to realign another persons structure. 

A reiki practitioner, projects “white light” ( SCALAR ENERGY ) toward a person with a “disharmonious” energy field. Depending on the experience of the healer and the strength (intent) of the projection, the white light, which is comprised of the theoretical highest frequency (and strength) will entrain the weaker EM field of the patient, eventually inducing resonance to occur, which strengthens the patient’s own EM field. The movement of blood through the circulatory system is another way that EM fields are produced.  Each cell in our bodies is a transmitting antenna. Our DNA is the master tuning fork of our body.

Newton's ideas of absolute space and time and Einstein's ideas of relative time and space, are replaced by a truer picture by true psychics, for whom the universe exists in a vast here --where HERE represents all points of space and time at a single instant. In the quantum world of the zero point field, subatomic particles exist in a state of all potential unless observed, when it gets frozen down to a single state.

Psychic remote viewers can see information encoded in quantum fluctuation. On the subatomic level MIND IS OVER MATTER.  We create time and space on the surface of our retinas. Nothing in this universe exists as an actual thing independently of our perception of it.

Biology is a quantum process for cell communications and higher brain functions of consciousness. .DNA is a superconductor that stores light at body temperature, and can create magnetic wormholes in ZPF .. Microtubules and axional membranes are also hollow cylinders.

Next time if you get a chance , take permission , go into a surgery room, and at a difficult moment of surgery clasp the patients hand and see for yourself the calming effects on the visual BP monitor -- only then will you get convinced that -- you are a healer too at your own sweet level.

My wife is a 4th degree Reiki Grandmaster ( one level above grandmaster ). There are grateful people who keeps her photo in their puja room --having cured them of cancer when all doctors gave up hope and gave them a few days to live. I discourage her from getting too deep and involved in all this-- for she has her own worldly life to live , as a mother with 2 young boys.

Grace and peace!

MEDITATION -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL



In my post about TEA -- I had mentioned how Bodhi Dharma cut off both his eye lids after 9 years of meditation -- in a fit of self inflictment.

To understand why he may have done this  -- you need to understand the process of GENUINE meditation.

The ancient Vedic  Indian psychology has a  fourfold scale, which represents the degrees of the ladder of being by which man climbs back to the source, the absolute divine. 

The change, from “here” to “there,”  is not an uneventful process at all. 

There come dry periods, deviations, violent alterations, and temptations. If there are raptures and azure heavens, there are anaconda agonies and absolute abandonments, howling hot deserts and “dark cold nights of the soul” to go through. 

Streaming tears of joy, horripilation (bristling of the hair), stigmata (bodily marks or pains), and parapsychological phenomena have been known to develop.

The first stage of meditation  achieves detachment from sensual desires and impure states of mind through analysis and reflection and thereby attains an emotional state of satisfaction and joy. 

In the second stage, intellectual activities are abated to a complete inner serenity; the mind is in a state of “one-pointedness” or concentration, joy, and pleasantness. 

In the third stage, every emotion, including joy, has disappeared, leaving the meditator indifferent to everything while remaining completely conscious. 

The fourth stage is the abandoning of any sense of satisfaction, pain, or serenity because any inclination to a good or bad state of mind has disappeared. The meditator thus enters a state of supreme purity, indifference to everything, and pure consciousness.


THE ANCIENT VEDIC RISHI IS THE GUY WHO CAN ENTER THE 4TH STATE AT HIS OWN SWEET WILL BY TOUCHING TWO FINGERS ( MUDRA )--THE STATE OF SUPREME INNER SILENCE,  VAST EXPANSION , NIL EMOTIONS AND PROFOUND KNOWINGNESS-- AWAY FROM MAYA . He offered certain molecules to his brain receptor sites--  more satisfying than LSD or Soma. His DNA remembers all the things that has ever happened to human beings.


Maya is the illusion of boundaries--the creation of a mind that has lost its cosmic perspective. People caught in the web Maya have lot of knowledge but little wisdom. They can see everything, but will miss the most important .

There were no bounds to the magical powers that can be attained by great Hindu ascetics and yogis  teaching the suppression of all activity of mind, body, and will in order that the self may realize its distinction from them and attain liberation.  

Prayer is NOT meditation. The former is a petition to  God, and the other is a detached observation of one's own mind, and its processes.

In the modern world, meditation is used as a non-religious technique for relaxation and stress reduction for long-term psychological improvements. Meditation is done to purify the mind and gain insight.  It abstracts the self from conscious thought, and frees the mind from feelings that cause stress and suffering.   It fosters creative intelligence, raise consciousness, and enables fuller use to be made of mental potential.

The spiritual aims are peace of mind, wisdom, and, ultimately, a state of enlightenment or self-realization.  It is a  form of natural healing, and helps people cope with  anxiety, depression, and drug dependence.

The attention is focused on monitoring the breath, and noting thoughts crossing the mind, without any judgement or attempt at control, but as a silent and detached witness.  If the mind throws up distractions, the meditator returns to simply observing the breath each time the distraction happens.  A relaxed and unhurried attitude is important, since slowing down and observing the mind to see how it works is central to the philosophy behind meditation.

Using the mantra technique, the meditator concentrates on a mantra  to banish intrusive thoughts and thus achieve progressively quieter levels of thinking until thought itself is transcended. The subtle vitalizing frequencies of mantras activate psychic energies and awaken our intuitive faculties. 


Sonic frequencies interact with our cellular vibration levels and assist in maintaining a healthy resonant frequency in our bodies. Mantras still the activity of thought and helps you find a deeper level of consciousness. You will believe in Mantras only if you see a video of the mind boggling perfect geometric patterns,  sand will form on a tonoscope ( cymatics ) 

Meditation brings peace and allows us to raise our vibrational level.  Digestion grounds us. Hence eat only after  the meditation session.  Eating engages the body’s digestive system , thus returning the body’s vibrational level back to normal.
 
During meditation thinking is separated from perceiving, so that the individual can stand apart from the emotional self.  The reason why people remain mired in negativity is because of the beliefs they have inherited over time. Beliefs are subconscious. 


We act in the way we do because we are not aware of our beliefs and the feelings that these beliefs generate. That is why it is important to obeserve yourself and look within. We can do it. That is why we are different from animals.

We can use our  conscious mind to observe ,to introspect and dip into the  subconscious where our beliefs are embedded , in order to eliminate it.  You can meditate to rewrite these negative programmes  that cause you misery.

To be a mystic or a seer is not the same thing as being a spectator on the fence.  Mysticism provides an escape from a life of uninspired existence. It magnifies man and gives him a hope and destiny to fulfill.

In the modern era the road to holiness necessarily passes through the world of action. 


A Mystic who is not of supreme service to the Society -- AINT NO MYSTIC AT ALL.

Two days ago a Kashmiri antique dealer enticed me to his shop in a mall in Chennai. 


While displaying his wares like handmade shawls costing over 1 lakh rupees, I noticed a Black Onxy gem stone pendant 3 inches long and 2 inches wide.  


He said the stone was found in Ladhak.  I immediately bought it at an exhorbitant price,  getting my son pissed off, at my naive foolishness.


So what did i buy?


Black onyx is the most powerful protection stone, worn by Buddhist monks in the Himalayas.  It is extremely shiny and has a hardness of 7 on the Moh’s scale. 


Black colour is the best absorber and radiator.  All south Indian temples have back idols which absorbs and radiates energy. ( North Indian temples have white statues )


Black Onyx atone absorbs all but 3% of the radiation that strikes its surface, regardless of its wavelength and reflects no light.


Hung on the solar plexus , it helps one to absorb from the universe only those energies which are needed . It can absorb and transform negative energy. Hence it can  relieve stress and give you emotional stability. It is almost like a Shiva linga in powers.


It can also radiate away and  release your ego and all that is not in harmony within you. It helps you to sleep better.
Black Onyx is can centre and align your total person to the higher powers. It can thus enhance self control and encourage happiness .
Onyx is a protective stone worn when facing adversaries in battles or conflicts of all kinds. It can also be used as a defense against negativity consciously directed against you. 
It eliminates negative thinking and can keep your emotions and passions under control. 
Black Onyx can assist you to discard vices and change habits. 

Black Onyx is good for opening the root chakra and is the stone for grounding. It increases concentration and  relieves tension. 

On the physical level it boosts cellular regeneration. 

This solid - feeling stone is in short brings you good fortune. It can store and modulate enormous amounts of energy.
Note:  Black Onyx has NIL streaks or spots or other colours like Black Agate, though both are Silicon Di Oxides. . Black Onyx will NOT allow light to pass through like Black Saphire, which is Aluminium Oxide..

THE ALPHA STATE AND EARTHS HEARTBEAT OF 7.83 HERTZ -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL



VEDIC OM 7.83 HZ — RE-DISCOVERED BY NIKOLA TESLA  / RE-INVENTED BY SCHUMANN.



Since life began, the Earth has been surrounding and protecting all living things with a natural frequency pulsation of 7.83 HZ—the ancient Indian Rishis called OM. 


OM mantra was uttered by the vedic sages who stayed on the banks of the river Saraswati in 9000 BC. Vedic civilization of Saraswati flourished till 4000 BC, till the river became non-perennial due to tectonic shifts blocking the Himalayan Glacier mouth. The elite then migrated all over including Western coast of India, Mesopotamia, Europe and Russia.

Mankind depends on two subtle environmental signals, the Yin from below and the Yang from above.  The Schumann wave surrounding our planet being YANG and the weaker geomagnetic waves coming from below, from within the planet, being the YIN signal.



The fundamental mode of Schumann's resonance is a standing wave in the ionospheric cavity with a wavelength of the circumference of the earth.



In deep meditation, when waves of alpha and theta rhythms cascade across the entire brain, a resonance is possible between the human being and the planet. Energy and information which are embedded in the zero point field or aether field are transferred. The planet communicates with us in this primal language of frequencies. A living being is a  EMF field embedded within the EMF field of the earth. Each cell's DNA as a vibrating transmitter/receiver of information.



Alpha brain Frequency of 7.83 HZ on the EEG,  is also known popularly as Schumann’s Resonance .  These frequencies start at 7.8 Hz and progress by approximately 5.9 Hz. (7.8, 13.7, 19.6, 25.5, 31.4, 37.3, and 43.2 Hz.).  




Resonances of earth, ie, 7.83,  13.7, 19.6, 25.5, 31.4, 37.3 and 43.2 Hertz of earth. We all know 7.83 hz being the strongest of all, OM or Schumann frequency.

Ohm- 7.83Hz
Gam - 13.7Hz
Hleem - 19.6Hz
Hreem - 25.5Hz
Kleem - 31.4Hz
Krowm - 37.3Hz
Sreem - 43.2Hz 


The Schumann Resonances are the result of cosmic energy build-up within the cavity that exists between Earth's highly conductive surface and the conducting layer in the upper atmosphere called the ionosphere. the space between the surface of the earth and the conductive ionosphere acts as a waveguide. The cavity is naturally excited by energy from lightning strikes. This ionospheric charge creates an electrical shield around the Earth.. The atmosphere is a dielectric insulator, which separates the two. Thus a spherical capacitor as well as a spherical resonator is created and maintained. Electrical signals of sufficient wavelength (low frequency) are wave-guided around and around between this "sphere within a sphere" and is the base Schumann Resonance of 7.8Hz mainly traveling from West to East. 

7.83 HZ or the ALPHA frequency  is the gateway that leads into deeper states of consciousness.
Most people are in an alpha state during the short time immediately before they fall asleep and when the conscious nervous system switches over to the subconscious.



Simply by closing your eyes, your brain starts to generate  alpha brain waves.  As more and more neurons are requited to this frequency, alpha waves cycle globally across the whole cortex. This induces of deep relaxation, but not quite meditation .

7 to 12 HZ range is frequency range for relaxed consciousness  , psychic Stimulation , mind body integration , inner awareness , visualization and  whole brain thinking. The alpha wave state is a sign of deep relaxation while awake.

Taking a break and meditation are two activities that  produce alpha waves You experience a liberating sense of peace and well-being. The "alpha state" is where meditation starts and you begin to access the wealth of creativity that lies just below our conscious awareness

Alpha is also the home of the window frequency known as the Schumann Resonance, which is the resonant frequency of the earth's electromagnetic field.

When we intentionally generate alpha waves and go into resonance with that earthy frequency, we naturally feel better, refreshed, in tune, in synch. It is, in fact, environmental synchronization.



The frequency of the living Earth, the “Schumann Resonance” of 7.83 HZ is the lowest common denominator of psychic activity repeatedly observed by EEG and EKG observations. Schumann Resonance  waves propagate with little attenuation around the planet..  For thousands of years the Schumann Resonance or pulse (heartbeat) of Earth has been 7.83 cycles per second, recently due to military ELF waves from HAARP , GWEN and Woodpecker,  this resonance has been slowly rising.



Schumann resonances are global electromagnetic resonances, excited by lightning discharges in the cavity formed by the Earth's surface and the ionosphere. This global electromagnetic resonance phenomenon is named after physicist  Winfried Otto Schumann who predicted it mathematically in 1952.




Tesla transmitted scalar waves mainly through the Earth, and Hertz waves between ground and the Heaviside layer, and found the resonant frequency of Earth of 7.83 HZ. This is  the Schumann resonance—LIFTED FROM TESLA TECHNOLOGY— OR REINVENTED MATHEMATICALLY several years later.



Tesla had also discovered the exact frequency at which the earth normally pulsates. These natural waves are created as a result of electrical activity in the atmosphere. These are quasi-standing [LONGITUDINAL SCALAR] ELF waves that naturally exist in the earth's electromagnetic cavity, the space between the ground and the Ionosphere.

The one sided use of Schumann (YANG) wave simulation without the geomagnetic (YIN) signal caused serious health problems. An underground bunker which completely screened out magnetic fields. suffered emotional distress and migraine headaches. After only a brief exposure to 7.8 Hz (the very frequency which had been screened out), the volunteers health stabilized again.

The same complaints were reported by the first astronauts and cosmonauts, who, out in space, also were no longer exposed to the Schumann waves. Now modern spacecrafts are said to contain a device which simulates the Schumann waves. by producing a 7.83 Hz pulse with a field generator (Schumann device), we can counter the effects of the irritating man-made fields. By replicating the Earth's natural rhythm, we may be providing ourselves (at least in our immediate vicinity) with a more healthy environment.



The electrons that are sent by the sun meet up with the negatively charged ionosphere and are repelled or slowed down and accumulated. The Earth's atmosphere is an insulator to electrons and they do not have enough inertial energy to penetrate it. The ionosphere is highly negatively charged (electrons) and conductive. The charge keeps increasing until the atmosphere beaks down and the electrons find their way to the Earth in the form of lightning.  Ionosphere surrounding our planet is electrically positive charged whilst the earth's surface carries a negative charge



In physics two concentric electrically charged balls, one placed inside the other, are called ball condensers, or capacitors. Lightning discharges produce electromagnetic waves. 

Every second 200 lightening strikes occur somewhere on earth in order to keep re establishing electrical balance between the earth and the ionosphere. These lightening strikes energize the 'flute' and vibrate the resonating cavity. The 'flute' vibrates waves that bounce off the ionosphere and then off the earth, back and forth. The resulting 'song' incorporates information from the ionosphere which reflects the universe and information about everything that occurs on earth. Usually this 'music' is described in terms of its beat or frequency. The beat frequency is called the Schumann Resonance. 

The electromagnetic waves ripple longitudinally from one end to another, and when they reflect back, interfere with the incident waves rolling forward, forming  Terrestrial Stationary waves. These waves have gently undulated for thousands of years  at frequencies that the Earth likes and rejoices in.
 

Enter the villain--

HAARP is slicing up the ionosphere, the world-brain, like a microwave knife, producing long tear incisions destroying the membrane which holds the reservoir of data accumulated by all earth's history . HAARP, (High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Programme )  ELF waves vibrate at the same frequency as the human brain.

By causing many towers [HAARP, GWEN, etc.] to pulse with the exact ELF frequency of the normal earth pulsation, scientists have learned how to not only create, but also how to maneuver and direct storms. Tesla’s discovery can duplicate almost every single phenomena of nature, from cyclones to tornado.

With the  earth's "pulse" rate  rising, and  her magnetic field strength,  declining., the field has lost most of its  intensity . This could cause a magnetic pole reversal soon.



The Ionosphere is being manipulated by US government military scientists using the Alaskan transmitter called HAARP, (High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program) which sends focused radiated power to heat up sections of the Ionosphere, which bounces power down again. ELF waves produced from HAARP, when targeted on selected areas, can weather-engineer and create mood changes affecting millions of people. Russians have their own programme. Japanese too have this mind altering psychotronic Tesla technology ( bought with tonnes of gold by the Japanese mafia Yakuza from Russia.)

Now something about Mobile phone antenna radiation which affects the Schumanns Resonance.  When resonance is established between the mobile phone antennas and your nervous system Energy is transferred from the spinning electrons (charged particles) from the antennas into the spinning ions (electrolytes) in a person's nervous system.




Cancer, hypertension, cardio, neurological, leukaemia, Alzheimer’s, reproductive and other diseases may be triggered and/or aggravated by disruptions in the Schumann Resonance that push it either too high above or too far below the master 7.83Hz frequency. Spinning ions, such as calcium, potassium, sodium and lithium, which normally govern cell metabolism, are kicked out of the cell into the bloodstream where they are deposited in the joints or eliminated. Calcium, potassium and lithium are ions that in addition to cell metabolism govern calmness, mental clarity and mood stabilization. 

Some specific examples are: accumulation of calcium in the joints has been related to arthritis, lack of potassium is related to Alzheimer’s and the lack of lithium is related to chronic depression and mood swings. Electro pollution from modern technology can cause us to feel more stressed, fatigued and "out of balance." 


In the quantum view we are essentially electrical beings existing in a state of resonance with the electromagnetic field of the earth.

10 Hz puts people into a hypnotic state. US, Russians, Japanese and North Koreans etc use this in portable mind-control machines to extract confessions.  

Even some catholic CHURCHES  use sound waves of their huge binaural organs  to create a sense of melancholy and to SINK IN THEIR HOOKS and help the congregation believe!  (  6.6 Hz causes depression).   



10.80 Hz have been used by Russians to cause  riotous behavior in sports stadiums . 


The Russians, having a head start on decoding the brain , can send subliminal messages by satellite over whole countries in their own languages, in scalar waves so subtle that the victims think they are their own thoughts occurring. They could make people think "God" is speaking to them and can also give a people suicidal thoughts. 



There is a suicide wavelength. Only certain people can pick this up according to whether they have implants (which relay messages into the head) or if they are natural telepathics.

Fire protection/ Alcohol resistant foram, regular foam, water spary ( not into closes tank ), dry chemical

Although TDI is a hazardous material, the hazard may be minimized if appropriate precautions are observed Typically, there are four routes of potential exposure: inhalation, skin contact, eye contact and ingestion.

Inhalation of TDI vapors may cause irritation of the mucous membranes of the nose, throat or trachea, breathlessness, chest discomfort, difficult breathing and reduced pulmonary function. It is important to avoid exposure above the TLV to minimize the possibility of respiratory sensitization.

Tests have shown that the least detectable odor level of TDI is approximately 0.2-0.4ppm. This odor threshold is significantly higher than the OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of 0.02 ceiling. If an individual can smell TDI, overexposure has most likely occurred. Airborne overexposure, well above the PEL, may result additionally in eye irritation, headache, chemical bronchitis, asthma-like findings, or pulmonary edema. TDI has also been reported to cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which is characterized by flu-like symptoms, the onset of which may be delayed.

Control of TDI exposure to the recommended guidelines (0.005 ppm as Time-Weighted Average, 0.020 ppm as Short Term Exposure Limit) is believed to protect against sensitization. However, if an individual has become sensitized to TDI, an asthma-like response may then result from very low exposures to TDI. In the event of skin contact, wash thoroughly with soap and flowing water for at least fifteen minutes (A recent study has indicated that corn oil or polyglycol-based cleaners may remove MDI more effectively than soap and water, and this may also apply to TDI.(5) Cleaning soon after contamination was also important.).

Promptly remove all contaminated clothing (including shoes) while washing. If the skin is burned or irritated, seek medical attention. Decontaminate clothing prior to re-use by soaking the garments in an 8 percent ammonia solution for one hour prior to laundering with hot water and detergent. Destroy all contaminated leather items including shoes, belts, and watchbands.

The  easiest and most convenient way to handle spilt TDI is to react it with polyol to produce a
low-quality foam, which then can be sold or used as a manufactured product. (CAUTION: The TDI/polyol reaction is exothermic, which may cause spontaneous combustion.)

Empty TDI drums can be decontaminated by filling them with water or a decontamination solution (5-10% sodium carbonate) and allowing them to stand unsealed for at least 48 hours. WARNING: Under no circumstances should empty drums be burned or cut open with a gas or electric torch, as toxic decomposition products may be liberated.

The use of suitable respiratory equipment is required whenever there is a potential for exposure to airborne TDI levels in excess of permissible exposure limits (PEL 0.02ppm-ceiling, TLV 0.005ppm - 8hour TWA).

Crush Amyl Nitrite capsules 5 times at 15 second intervals and hold under nose of a gassed victim.

200 Ltrs Aqua Ammonia
200 Ltrs IPA 30% (Iso propyl alcohol)—to use as solvent if TDI falls on skin.
Two litres of 1% Tincture of Green Soap
In case of spill first neutralize it with 50% Ethyl Alcohol, 40% water and 10% conc Ammonia.   If spill is small mix with sand or Sodium Bicarbonate. Pack it in a cardboard box and burn it in an open pit using paper as fuel.

EXTRA EQUIPMENT NEEDED:

Sufficient extra hoses (not ships normal hoses) and/or SS pipe  enable reach manifold area from pumpstack.

Two SS Spool pieces each with one inch drain valve fitted. ,

Two SS portable valves for the pumpstack.

Prior to Loading:

TDI, Clean tank to water white plus standard

Pressure test heating coils for leaks, then air blow water condensate from coils, followed by nitrogen blowing to ensure moisture free.  Blank off both inlets and returns. The cargo is water reactive and hence ensure NO water comes in contact.

Check/test function of PV Valve

Air blow PV vent line to ensure no water trapped in Line (especially if slight list or trim).

Mop dry cargo pump deepwell.

Pressure test cargo pump cofferdam. Purge out cofferdam with nitrogen and fill completely with DOP             ( Dioctyl Phthalate which has a VD of 13.5). 

Fit pressure gauge to vent line so tank pressure can be monitored during loading, voyage and discharge.

Prepare/connect vapour return system.  Calculate Pressure Drop.

Prepare 200 ltrs of neutraliser in case of spills:
80 ltrs freshwater, 100 ltrs IPA Iso propyl alcohol , 20 ltrs Aqua Ammonia.

Prepare a solution of 99% IPA and 1% Tincture of Green Soap for personal protection.

Loading  TDI or MDI

Cargo tank will be purged with Nitrogen to minus 40 deg C dew point or 0.25% by shore and pressure may be as high as 10 bars, therefore leave tank cleaning hatch and ullage hatch open as well as PV valve to ensure whole system is purged and tank does not have structural damage due to over pressurization.

When nitrogen purging is complete and shut down, secure the tank and put PV valve in normal operating position.

Ensure safety shower in operation.

Draeger tubes must be ready for use around the cargo area. Tape off and cordon the loading area.

When shore ready to start.  Open valves at shore connection and pumpstack.

For TDI you cannot do open ullaging or sampling.

         On Completion Loading

Shore will blow line with nitrogen to tank.
Close all valves and disconnect shore hose and vapour return.
Samples must be taken with closed sampling device.
Fill ships hoses with Toluene using Graco pump. Leave the Toluene inside for 3 days.
Wash hoses with warm water 50-60 C and steamed out and drained. 

Voyage

Heat as per charterers instructions by Adjacent Heated Cargo ONLY, unless ship has thermal oil heating,( TDI Normally 35 C ). Do not allow the temp to go below 21C or >45C
Do NOT have any cold ballast in the double skin.
Maintain nitrogen blanket at positive pressure, minimum 50 mb.

Discharging

Use vapor return hose . DO NOT DISCHARGE without vapour return hose.
Inert with N2 while discharging.

Cargo hoses to be blown with shore nitrogen at end of dischg. Fill Chlorinated solvent via manifold from storage cargo tank.

Pre-Cleaning

Chlorinated solvent 8-10 M3 of moisture spec <400ppm should already have been loaded into clean extra-dry tank and heated to 30-35 C for TDI ). The chlorinated solvent has to be heated to >MP of the Isocyanate, but

Prepare 2 SS tank cleaning machines and TDI resistant cleaning hoses.

Release ullage hatch but do not lift open, open PV valve. (in case of rapid pressure increase when solvent added.)

Transfer this solvent to cargo tank via manifold and through cargo hoses with pumpstack valve closed initially to ensure line is totally filled, then opened fully until all solvent transferred into tank.

Disconnect cargo hose from pump stack and connect blind flange with Y for tank  cleaning hose to fit.

Place machines in tank and cover opening to stop any liquid splashing out.

Commence circulation full strength for minimum two hours. Shore to supply Nitrogen continuously during circulation. At this time reconnect shore line (or shore slop line) to ships line ready for use.

After circulation, disconnect blind with Y and reconnect ships hose to pumpstack, and pump out to shore the Solvent TDI slop. After stripping blow line again with nitrogen, Stop shore nitrogen to tank and batten down tank until at sea.

When shore hose finally disconnected, fill ships hose/line again with chlorinated solvent as previously done.

NOTE: IF SHORE IS UNABLE TO ACCEPT THESE CATEGORY  Y  SLOPS AND THESE ARE BEING TAKEN TO ANOTHER PORT FOR DISPOSAL, REMOVE TANK CLEANING MACHINES AND BATTEN DOWN TANK TO AVOID MOISTURE ENTERING. 

SLOP SHOULD NOT BE CARRIED FOR LONG PERIODS AS POLYMERISATION CAN OCCUR.

Cleaning at Sea

After the solvent wash—wash the tank with water and detergent as if the solvent was the last cargo. .Make the entries in the Cargo record book.

Blow out cargo hoses, rig tank cleaning machines.

Blow out DOP from pump cofferdam (overboard) and flush with MEC then blow dry with nitrogen.
          
If some Methylene chloride is left in the sump put some Methanol into the tank and keep heating coils crack open.

First give a cycle cold sea water wash, but above the MP of TDI which is 19.5 deg C.

Then Hot wash tank for 2 hours with sea water.
Give FW rinse .
Steam tank for 2 hours, then mechanically ventilate for 3 hours.

Test tank with Draeger tube before entering to inspect.
TDI is a bad previous cargo for PTT and UV test.

There may be some tough brownish film residue or URETHANE layer ( moisture effect ) which is difficult to remove. Scour with 3m Scotch brite abrasive pads.  You may find polymerised bubbles with liquid cargo underneath and will need to neutralise.

TDI and MDI are extremely poisonous so take no chances, wear the correct safety equipment and do not try to rush the operation of this cargo at any stage.

If Gasoil is used for cleaning ( for TDO only ) , make sure the moisture is <400 ppm at 10 Cum per tank.. Recirc Gasoil for 2 hrs. Toluene can be used for line cleaning.  4 parts of Gasoil are required to dissolve 1 part of TDI.

Loading Arrangement

Reacts violently with acids, alcohols and strong acids.

If inhibited by Ammonia do not stow in zinc tank ( pH >9 ).

Solubility, - soluble in Acetone and Kerosene

Flammable at high temperatures. Fire will cause polymerization and dangerously high pressures.

Reacts slowly with water producing C02,(Carbon dioxide),

Vapor is strong irritant to eyes and throat causing eye and lung injury, even low concentrations cannot be tolerated. On heating MDI gives toxic vapors of Carbon Monoxide, oxides of Nitrogen and Hydro Cyanide gas with very high VP.

REACTIVITY: MDI is unstable in traces of moisture, slowly forming C02 gas (carbon dioxide)

SAFETY: Full protective clothing and self contained breathing apparatus when handling hoses,valves,connections,tank cleaning machines.

Heat as per charterers instructions by Adjacent Heated Cargo ONLY, unless ship has thermal oil heating,

Fill ships hoses with chlorinated solvent like Perchloroethylene or Methylene chloride for MDI,
say 200 Ltrs for each hose length x 2  (loading and discharging)

At normal unloading and storage temperatures, MDI has a relatively low vapor pressure. With adequate ventilation, airborne MDI vapor concentrations are unlikely to reach or exceed exposure guidelines.

Nevertheless, at elevated temperature, or if MDI is aerosolized by compressed airblow , health problems will result.

Inhalation of MDI may cause irritation of the mucous membranes of the nose, throat or trachea,
breathlessness, chest discomfort, difficult breathing and reduced pulmonary function. It is important to avoid exposure above the TLV to minimize the possibility of respiratory sensitization.

Overexposure well above the PEL may result in eye irritation, headache, chemical bronchitis, asthma-like symptoms or pulmonary edema. Diisocyanates have also been reported to cause hypersensitivity
pneumonitis, which is characterized by flu-like symptoms, the onset of which may be delayed. Skin contact may result in an irritant or allergic contact dermatitis and may play a role in respiratory sensitization.

Skin staining or discoloration may occur. Long term contact may cause redness, swelling and blistering. Control of MDI exposure to the recommended guidelines (0.005 ppm as Time Weighted Average, 0.020 ppm as Ceiling) is believed to protect against sensitization. However, if an individual has become sensitized to MDI, an asthma-like response may then result from very low exposures.
The ACGIH TLV for MDI is 0.005 ppm (0.05 mg/m3) as an 8-hour Time Weighted Average (TWA). OSHA requires that exposures be controlled to below a PEL of 0.02 ppm (0.2 mg/m3) as a ceiling, to prevent lung tumours.

In the event of skin contact, wash thoroughly with soap and flowing water ( corn oil or polyglycol-based cleaners may remove MDI more effectively than soap and water. Decontaminate clothing prior to re-use by soaking the garments in an 8 percent ammonia solution for one hour prior to laundering with hot water and detergent.

When transferring MDI, personal protective equipment should be worn by crew engaged in cargo work, tankcleaning
This may, depending upon conditions, consist of:
• Chemical goggles;
• Face shield;
• Chemical gloves, resistant to MDI

RAY ALLEN AND OCD -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL


Ray Allen hit a record 8 three pointers in the 2nd NBA finals for Boston Celtics against Los Angeles lakers, yesterday.

He is the most accurate 2 pointer  shooter of NBA too.

He suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

When you suffer from  psycho neurotic disorder (OCD) you develop anxiety , become nervous and develop strange repetitive habits. 

Michael Jackson did more than 30 plastic surgeries.

To be a excellent shooter in basketball you have to be IN THE ZONE.

It is about the mysterious K force which makes you left and right brain lobe work in harmony-- when action and awareness is in perfect sync--  and body and mind works in unison..

It is possible that in the next match Ray Allen is NOT in the zone -- - and hence misses all his shots.

A list of super achievers who had OCD ( a penalty you have to pay for the divine assistance ) are below--

Beethoven
Einstein
Nikola Tesla
Michael Angelo
Charles Dickens
Darwin.

SCALAR TANGO IN ZERO POINT FIELD -- THE COSMIC DANCE OF SHIVA-- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL








THE COSMIC DANCE OF SHIVA --  SCALAR TANGO IN ZPF

Society honours its live “matrix trapped conformists”  and dead “ freethinking troublemakers ”. 




All those who thought the great levitated cosmic dance of Lord Shiva mentioned in our ancient texts,  was mere Hindu religious gibberish in Sanskrit hymns – read on.  










All energy is a spiral , rather a vortex--there is nothibg called a wave , you see in physics books.


Our blood contains the electrogenetic coil in the shape of DNA,-- the sacred spiral.

The mysterious Spiral is a uniting symbol for all the subjects ,cosmology, quantum physics, psychology, philosophy, ancient civilisations, megalithic cultures and all occult belief systems.

In real nature, in the proverbial real “real world”, there is no such thing as a circle.   This is the naked truth. Nature is in constant evolution—It can never ever be a circle,--rather it is a SPIRAL which swings on and on, upwards, higher and higher still, ever changing, where not a single thing remains the same from one loop to the next, forever and ad infinitum.




Even magnetism is a spiral.

Our  enchanted world is in full forward flow. It must. It was never designed to stand still and sink into chaos and atrophy.

Empty space is not empty at all!

The vacuum is actually a plenum. It contains an abundant amount of energy, the zero point energy.


There is a cosmic dance of energy back and forth between the physical realm and the zero point field, a constant creation and destruction of matter from the void. 



The continuous flow of energy in and out of the material world is THE COSMIC DANCE OF SHIVA.  This is different from the tamas-rajas or yin-yang.

All below has been seen and understood  by the ancient Indian Vedic seers by resonating their king sized transceiver pineal glands-- thousands of years ago. 


The Vedic civilization is the oldest in the world. It flourished on the banks of the river Saraswati from 9000 BC to 4000 BC. The river dried up due to a block on the glacial mouth at the Himalayas due to a tectonic plate shift. The sages has 12 strand DNA and king sized resonating pineals glands.


By the way, ever since a grander, bigger and older Stonehenge ( by 2 millenniums ) was unearthed at Arkaim , Cheliabinsk , Russia and Putin went there to check out the SWASTIKA symbol on pottery, the whole world has started claiming this symbol for themselves. Even the Greek claimed it on their helmets . I must put it on record here the great Aryan Emperor Vikramaditya ruled from Jerusalem to Urals to Vietnam in 7000 BC, and Swastika was his royal seal. Swastika is always found on the palm of Shiva's son Ganesha or Ganapathi. 





Ganesha sitting on a inset of Swastika has been unearthed at Harappa/ Mohenjodaro pottery too of the Indus valley. Hitler stole the Swastika symbol, after Vatican and Rothschild ( opium drug cartel kingpin and owner of British East India company  ) spread the false Vatican sponsored rumour that blonde Boris Becker type Aryans invaded into India. IT was never the case, Aryan went OUT of India in 4000 BC to the west Sumeria and Mesopotamia.  Dryuhus ( Druids ) of Harry Potter series went up North. DNA tests clearly bear out the fact that even the Dravidians of south India ( like me ) have the same DNA as the North Indians.




Getting back--


Our DNA which can be  be influenced by scalar waves and acoustics ( mantras ) can send and receive powerful data through a universal network of ether  The primary function of our DNA is not protein synthesis, as biologists will tell you , but the reception and transfer of electromagnetic energy.



The entirety of thermodynamics is represented by the narrow infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is insignificant in a context of 0 Hz to infinite Hz.  We have much to learn, especially where thermodynamics and electromagnetism meet.



We can tap into the Zero Point Energy field.  Positrons emanate from "the quantum vacuum"  and get annihilated. These are energy oscillations at zero degrees Kelvin, where all activity in an atom ceases. 



It is called vacuum energy because it is descriptive of the energy in a perfect vacuum, where no light or matter is present. In this state, random electromagnetic oscillations can still be observed, meaning that there is still some energy present.  Such RESIDUAL energy is enormous and a cup of it could boil off the planet’s oceans in a few seconds.

For a diatomic (two atoms) molecule, for example, the zero-point energy per mole, E0, can be given by the equation:

E0 = y N h c f
where N is the Avogadro constant number of 6.0221367 × 1023  ,   h is Planck’s constant of 6.626 × 10-34 joule-seconds, c is the velocity of light in vacuum of 299,792,458 m/sec , and f is the frequency of vibration depending on the mass of the molecule, (which is different  for different isotopes of the same element.).










  
This is the zero point effect resulting from a very complex scalar-wave interaction between electromagnetic
 fields and matter.






A scalar wave is far different from a regular wave in that a scalar wave goes in all directions into the surroundings. A vector quantity has magnitude and direction while a scalar quantity has only magnitude



Newton’s famous law of inertia of classical physics states that inertia is the product of mass and acceleration, F= m * a.  He got it wrong.  Inertia is simply the resistance, the drag that objects experience when accelerated in the zero point field.

The energy in between the atoms is referred to as the vacuum or the ether (akasha ) and is chaotic,  unpatterned, zero-point energy. The quantity of the energy is limitless. Tapping the zero-point energy means making one or more energy patterns reverberate, which will cause extra energy to follow suit, just like acoustic amplification in a wind instrument or Bose wave-radio.




That is how "free-energy", "over-unity machines", "zero-point energy", or "fuel-less generators" really work.  No colleges teach this and no experts can imagine this— super genius Nikola Tesla could. He was introduced to this akasha concept by the great Indian master Vivekananda.

Ordinary electromagnetic waves are transverse waves, while scalar waves are longitudinal. 





Strangely these scalar waves do not actually exist in our "material" world,  but exist only in the vacuum of empty space, or the time domain. 




There are only a little over 100 atoms in all the Universe that we know of.  All that we see is built out of these and out of a combination of these.  All atoms are made up of protons, electrons and neutrons, except hydrogen which has no neutron.  No atom is different than the other except in number:  Helium, Calcium, Titanium, Tin, whatever; they are all the same thing . . .except in number.  


They follow an orderly mathematical progression.  Dimitry Mendeleyev noted that Indian Sanskrit grammarian Panini who could think about this progression in alphabets of  a language 7000 years ago .  Hydrogen, the simplest atom, has 1 proton in the nucleus and 1 electron in orbit.  Helium has 2.    3 protons in the nucleus and 3 electrons in orbit is no longer a gas,  it is like magic Lithium, a silver-white light weight metal of atomic number 3 .  It goes on and on to Seaborgium, with 106 protons in the nucleus and electron configuration 2-8-18-32-32-12-2.



Therefore, the difference between all matter is electromagnetic energy created by the different number of these charged particles, not in the basic make up of these particles as individuals.  The reason Nitrogen and Oxygen are such different gases cannot be that Nitrogen has 7 protons and 7 electrons and that Oxygen has 8 of each. Hence it is the different amount of electromagnetic energy that that one proton and one electron make that changes the substance. 


The understanding of chemical bonding has been  fundamentally transformed by quantum mechanics, as in Schrödinger's wave equations. New fields in physics emerged after Newtons ideas were discarded into the dustbin of history , in favour of quantum mechanics and relativity — solid-state physics, condensed-matter physics, superconductivity, nuclear physics, and elementary particle physics—  all of these found a consistent basis in quantum mechanics.  No fundamental deficiencies have been found in quantum mechanics, since the past 7 decades.



Again, the difference is not in the makeup of the particles, but in the space between the particles in orbit (electrons) and the nucleus (with protons). 


That space is the substance of everything. That space is electromagnetic energy.  That space is “reality.” 
That space is the atom.  Electromagnetism is the substance of everything.  In essence, that “space” is the substance of all structure.  





The electrons, protons and neutrons are only a small part of the atom.  It is the space between them that is, ironically, the “substance.” 


Within the electromagnetic force of the atom is the key to everything:  creation, transmutation . . .limitless power.


Water molecule is H2O.  In other words, 2 atoms of Hydrogen and 1 atom of Oxygen.  Two gases combine to make a liquid.  It is not a material difference:  the protons are still protons, the electrons still electrons.  
Electromagnetic energy has been affected by the proximity of these charged particles making up the atoms.  A new substance is created.  Amazing, right?



The electron spins around the nucleus (or center) of an atom and is responsible for electrical and chemical actions. Time is a measure of the phase cycle of an electron.  UTC is based on atomic clock.

When an electron is  made to rise up to another shell or orbit and some energy was needed for this shift upwards to be done – this energy is the ZERO point energy.  When an electron in orbit around the nucleus of an atom drops to a lower, less energetic orbit, a photon containing the energy equivalent to the electron's energy drop is emitted.

This explains why light and other forms of electromagnetic energy such as gamma rays  are sometimes observed as particles and other times as waves. The heated filament of a light bulb is an example of photon production. 


Scalar waves interact with atomic nuclei, rather than with electrons.  Scalar EM pulse does not react with the orbital electron shells of an atom, but passes directly into the nucleus and is absorbed there. 



Scalar waves are very different from electromagnetic waves.  They can travel over immense distances with no loss of energy at super-luminal speed ( faster than light! ).

Scalar waves can be regarded as electromagnetic longitudinal soundwaves. 


These longitudinal waves are force-free, unless when they come in touch with matter and can be used for healing at a distance, for a cure for specific diseases or to fight the aging process that physical reality itself is deterministically tuneable, changeable, engineerable, and not fixed at all. This is the Reiki universal life force energy— which even the Japanese founder Dr  MikaoUsui who re-invented it from Indian Vedic times , did not understand.



The speed of light (communication), or electron to electron reaction, is slower than the speed of gravity, or quark to quark reaction. The higher the scalar wave frequency, the faster the time rate.



Quarks make up Protons and Neutrons inside the nucleus of atoms. If Quarks are confined inside neutrons and protons, how do we know they are there, or even exist at all?


The answer to that is from particle accelerators – huge acceleration rings built underground like the one at CERN in Switzerland.   Particles such as a proton are accelerated faster and faster round the ring, then at some incredible speed, they are collided at one of 4 ‘inner tracker’ targets situated on the ring. – they collide there and split up, giving sub-particle traces.

Collision Energy will be 1150 TeV (that’s only 150 times  the energy of motion, of a dang flying mosquito—that is the funny part ).


Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) demonstrate the reverse process. Photons , the particle-like energy packets that constitute light radiation, from a super powerful short-pulse glass laser, producing a half trillion watts of power in a beam 6 micrometres  across, were arranged to interact with a pulsed beam of high-energy electrons. Some of the photons collided with the electrons, gaining a huge energy boost, and recoiled back along the line of the laser beam. A number of those energetic photons collided with oncoming laser photons and, in so doing, sufficiently broke down the vacuum to produce pairs of electrons and positrons. 


The experiment marked the first time that the creation of matter from radiation had been directly observed.  Pair production (the formation of a positron and an electron ) happens when electromagnetic energy interacts with matter. This is the cosmic dance of Shiva, envisioned in their third eye or Irridium charged and soma resonated pineal gland  by Himalayan masters thousand of years ago, without a accelerator. 



Digression: Newton of 18th Century is called the father of Calculus.  Bhaskara , the great Indian mathematician invented Calculus a thousand years before Newton,  for calculating rates of change, gradients of curves  and the calculation of lengths, areas, and volumes. We in India know that our great Sanskrit texts on Shiva’s cosmic dances, went missing before Quantum theory could give birth in the west. Newton lifted whole sale from the Calculus book of Parameshwara.



Wherever there is an electric current, there always will be a magnetic field at a right angle to it.  Magnetism goes hand in hand with electricity.  



The electron is considered a negative charged particle, while the proton is regarded as a positive charged particle, hence the attraction between them.  A neutron is considered a neutral charge and capable of taking either charge .


The atom is like a solar system as  most of it empty space. The structure of the atom is energy in a confined space between revolving charged particles. .  The electrons, protons and neutrons are only a small part of the atom.  It is the space between them that is,  ironically, the “substance.”   This space in this case filled with electromagnetic energy.





What is this atomic formula?—take a guess 


C3032H4812N780Fe4O872S12



It is the most complex molecule known to man:  the red blood cell.   


It is something so tiny one needs a high powered microscope in order to see it.  The speed with which the red blood cell carries out its complex functions is incredible.  The complex data it carries is even more mindboggling. 


All matter is not only mostly energy, but it is mostly space.   The red blood cell, thus translates to 102,408 charged particles making up the atoms of its structure.  These same particles are what is in your computer key board, a wall, a car, rubber, anything.  The red blood cell is different just because of their arrangement.  This creates the red blood cell.  Remove the space from that red blood cell and no microscope will be able to detect those tiny particles.


It is the same for everything.  Remove the space from it, and you have zilch.


Space has an energy density of 1094 grams per cubic centimeter. To call space a “vacuum” or the “quantum vacuum” is a misnomer because everything that we know about space indicates that it is not empty.




It is not a vacuum but rather a plenum—an absolute fullness, characterized by nearly infinite energy density and boundless luminosity. Space is literally efflorescing with virtual photons and electron-positron pair production. It is not dead, empty or inert but radiant and shimmering with energetic potential.



This all-pervading continuum or unified field has the features and qualities of what indigenous people called the Great Spirit. The infinite potential of the plenum is our potential.




The sacred geometry above is the 11000 year old Sri Yantra, formed by 9 interlacing 3D cones. . The red dot in the middle is the Bindu-- Modern science has still NOT understood SINGULARITY, the still point in the middle of a black hole.

We are one with the quantum plenum! Our bodies are piezo-electric bio-crystals, resonant transducers of living light and life force. 



We have unlimited access to the radiant field of consciousness which is infinite active universal intelligence. We all have direct and immediate access to that ZP field, which has been referenced by the spiritual traditions as the Divine Being.

The world we see is 3-dimensional. Time is the 4th dimension. Thought (or the mind) is beyond the scope of this explanation of the forces of nature,  but it is at least one additional dimension.


Simply consider there are 30,000,000,000 red blood cells in the body.  Mathematically, it is possible to determine how many electrons and protons and neutrons make up the blood.  Add the volume of all tissues, of every atom from calcium to Iron, to whatever.  It is beyond numbers .  Take all the space out of the human body and all these charged particles would form a pile that is so miniscule that it is invisible.


The atoms of our body:  hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, calcium, zinc, iron, whatever, are the same as those in the wall or your computer , they are in all tune, on the same frequency.  


An electric current is nothing more than electron particles traveling along in the same direction, usually along a wire.



If we were to take 1,000,000 volts of high frequency electricity (at 60 cycles alternating current) 1 ampere measurement of electric energy is equal to 63.3 billion billion electrons per second at any given point of the current.  But change the frequency of that electricity.  Change it to 65,000 cycles, and you can channel that 1 million volts through your body and out your fingertips like lightning . . . if metal thimbles are provided to allow a point of discharge.  



1,000,000 volts of electricity through a human body while  standing on the conductor?. The electrons will pass through harmlessly . . .  All that is required is a change of frequency.  Quantum physics shows that energy of an electron depends on its frequency.



So, one thing is common to all the Universe,  to all reality — electromagnetic energy.


All atoms are in vortex kinesis. It is spinning energy, an intensified example of the natural state of any matter. An energy vortex, like a magnetic vortex, would have unlimited potential on the wavelengths around this planet since it would disrupt them first.  One would not have to waste time trying to bend them with a huge atomic mass like a planet. Even the great galaxies rotate.  In relation to a galaxy, our solar system is nothing more than a tiny atom.



Vast swirling energy of a typhoon in the Pacific is centered at its imploding vortex core.


A spinning magnetic field (vortex) affects the most mysterious force field of gravity.  The alarming relationship of gravity to a spinning magnetic field opens the door for fruitful discussions of time and space. 


Gravity is more than simple attraction.  It is orientation. 

Atomic clocks placed at orbital heights recorded time passing just slightly faster than those at sea level—just because  gravity is weaker higher up.  The atomic clock installed at US NIST in 1999 , which measures light emitted by supercooled Caesium atoms as they fall though a microwave cavity, can run for 20 million years without losing or gaining a second


Where gravity, and hence a curvature of space, was greatest time moved more slowly; where it was not, more quickly.  The passage of time as we record and experience it here was actually slower than in space.

Gravity is a function of time.  . Time is a measure of the phase cycle of an electron. UTC is based on atomic clock.

A intense, non-tuned anti gravity wave will shatter metals. Sound under water travels at a speed that is five times higher than in the air  .At the equator an object actually falls slower than at the poles.


Time seems influenced by the physical as well:  at a higher altitude actually record time passing faster, where gravity and magnetism are weaker. 

Gravity can even affect the travel of light. Black holes exist in space, where gravity is so strong the light cannot escape, where not even time can be registered for the clock would stop, where everything vanishes.

Gravity can be reduced, nullified and inverted by means of electromagnetic radiation.


Dark matter is a constant sea of matter traveling the opposite direction in the timeline, only appearing for a moment, seeming to travel beyond light-speed, but still exerting gravity.



Gravity is the result of an amount of matter pulling itself together, to create compressive force toward the center, which curves all energy paths both directions in the 4th dimension The closer to center-of-gravity, the faster energy moves, hence the inward pull of gravity.  The gravity “field” is the area where spacetime tries to even itself out. 



Newton of apple bump on head fame, viewed gravity as an actual force. ( he did not discover gravity ,while on the potty! ). Newtons "isolated systems " are NOT found in nature. He did NOT understand what he presented to the world as 99% of his work , including calculus was stolen from 6000 year old Vedic era books.




That is two bodies in free space would attract each other by the force of gravity.  However in general relativity the more informed Einstein states that gravity is not a force but the curving of space-time up into a higher dimension.


The universe as we know it is made up of four dimensional space-time, three dimensions of space and one of time. But when a mass is present space-time is curved up into the fifth dimension outside of space and time. This means that time and space may be manipulated by the presence of mass, the denser the mass the greater the warping of space-time.


Einstein worked on the unified field theory (UFT) that tried to explain how electromagnetism and gravity are related. Maxwell showed the link between electricity and magnetism in the late eighteen hundreds, so Einstein tried and failed to include gravity within this theory.


Magnetism is an extension of the weak and strong forces. The electron forces spiral around the proton forces and in most materials the forces just even out like balanced atoms do, but when they interact with certain molecules (iron, cobalt, etc), the energies interact. The repulsive electron forces repel when identically spiraled forces combine (north on north, south on south), and the attractive forces dominate when opposite spiraled forces interact. We can assume that the North Pole is right-hand threaded, and obviously the opposite side would spin the opposite way (south is left-hand threaded). 



 The forces of nature are ruled by the right-hand rule.

There are three main types of electromagnetic resonance, NMIR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), ESR (Electron Spin Resonance) and cyclotron resonance. With NMR atomic nuclei are made to precess under the influence of a magnetic field, then, while in this state they can absorb electromagnetic energy. If the energy is of the right frequency, then magnetic resonance occurs. ESR is similar, however in this case electrons are made to resonate, rather than atomic nuclei. Cyclotron resonance can be applied to any type of charged particle and not just nuclei and electrons.



Light is an electromagnetic process, -- invisibility can be  caused by bending light around an object.  Why do we see astronomers running to places where there is total solar eclipse?  To observe stars behind the sun!.





The bending of light is known as refraction and is dependent upon the electric and magnetic characteristics of the substance through which it is traveling.  A cyclotronic field may be generated by sweeping a cloud of electrically charged gas (plasma) with a rotating magnetic field. At the same time a high frequency scalar electric field from a  Tesla coil can stimulate the gas molecules into cyclotronic resonance. This is what has been used on the USS Eldridge in the secret Philadelphia experiment ( there is a Hollywood movie on this ) conducted by Einstein, Tesla and Von Neumann. 




This cyclotronic field could induce electromagnetic energy into matter causing it to rise dimensionally up into hyperspace either by causing NMR/ESR .




John von Neumann, was a Hungarian genius of mathematics. Neumann had the ability to turn complex abstract theory into working technology.  Nikola Tesla and Von Neumann were more intelligent than Einstein.  

Only Neumann could understand Tesla’s unique genius. Neumann is the father of the high speed electronic computer.


When you study higher level physics, it becomes apparent that space and time are inextricably related to each other. It is considered less accurate to refer to just space or time by itself (because they don't exist by themselves.) That would be like saying your mouth ate the dinner.

Consciousness of time can be likened to a deep hypnosis which causes one to be in sympathy with the various frequencies and pulses of the physical universe our human brain is in reality none other than a biological space-time energy transducer. As such, it creates not only space, but also time. When scalar beams charge through hyperspace the flow of time gets redirected temporarily.



When scalar waves are created by a dipole, such as a battery, a generator or a permanent magnet with two poles, the polarisation of charge will create scalar waves that rush between the dipole and the vacuum. Every dipole in the universe from the atom with its positive and negative charges, to the Earth and the Sun with its magnetic fields and all the other heavenly bodies in the universe radiate scalar waves, so basically scalar waves are everywhere in the universe, they fill the vacuum of space making it a plenum of zero point energy.
In the early 20th century Nikola Tesla was the first to discover the scalar wave. He used induction coils to create these scalar waves. 


Motionless Electromagnetic Generator, magnetic field inside of a magnetic metal core (thick square frame shape), with two small control coils and two larger generator coils with a control circuit. Uses magnetism to tap zero-point energy. 

Einstein’s Relativity was, of course, E = mc2 — that is, energy equals mass times the speed of light squared.   It means that there is an incredible amount of energy in any object, if we could just get at it in the nucleus of its atoms.

Monoatomic elements can be used for regeneration of cells and DNA repair. They are abundant in seawater, dirt, rock, plants, fresh water, and the air.  Monatomic elements can be uptaken from food, especially from organic plant material grown in certain volcanic areas.  



However no antioxidant is as powerful as thought.
In a high spin state the atom interacts with the zero point and space-time differently. (Investigation of this monatomic phenomena maybe the key to The Grand Unified Theory for electromagnetic forces, nuclear forces and gravity .) According to monatomic theory these atoms in a high spin state are used by life to superconduct consciousness and energy.

Superconductors and lasers are the best known examples of quantum coherence—communication between atom and atom proceeds via state resonance

Zero Point Field—the mother of all fields—provides the ultimate holographic blueprint of the world for all time, past and future. It is this that we tap into when we see the past or future.
 
Scalar waves might be the point of fundamental intersection where matter and consciousness can influence each other. Their effect is independent of distance and time and is 4 times stronger than that of electromagnetic fields. 



They are prior to, that is more fundamental than magnetic fields and they transmit information, not energy. The transmission of scalar information creates consciousness fields— Morphogenic Fields. They cannot be detected by the usual instruments for measuring electric and magnetic fields, which work by interacting with electron flow and energy transmission


Scalar wavelengths belong to the subtle gravitational field and are also known as gravitic waves. Uniquely, they flow in multiple directions at right angles off electromagnetic waves, as an untapped energy source called 'potentials'. Potentials are particles which are unorganized in hyperspace - pure etheric energy not manifest in the physical world. In comparison, electromagnetic waves exist normally in the physical world, but can only be measured up to levels determined by the sensitivity of the equipment being used as to how many cycles per second they operate

Kundalini, the  subtle energy propounded by Indian Rishis thousands of years ago, residing like a coiled serpent in the base of the spine in a latent state ( for deliverance from this world to a higher one of supreme truth ) , has scalar wave origins. Kundalini and healing energy of Reiki master healers  are one and the same. 



The serpent on Shiva shows releases Kundalini.


When my wife ( who is one step above Reiki grandmaster level ) did her Kundalini raising--the Guru aborted  at 4th stage , as she developed severe gas in the stomach and discomfort ).








Scalar waves are capable of acting on living organisms at a sub-atomic level, and certain frequencies of scalar have been shown to destroy viruses and bacteria. And since telepathic messages between organisms seem to be able to pass through lead enclosures, such ESP may not be communicated on the electromagnetic scale, but through scalar waves.




Scalar waves propagate at faster-than-light speed except when transmitting scalar information on electromagnetic carrier waves. If something travels faster than light, it means that it can penetrate any matter as though it wasn’t there. Therefore scalar waves pervade all matter and cannot be shielded against by Faraday cages. Reiki healing waves pass through the earth.



Kundalini which exhibits pronounced psychic and trans-temporal effects is the 'channel' that connects the unmanifest void, with the manifest world of subatomics, atoms, molecules and cells and is the cellular expression of energy generated from the vacuum . 

Kundalini buffers the harshness of bare reality.  Increased heart field and EMF of the nervous system during the peak kundalini, acts like a biological synchrotron to actually change certain elements in the central nervous system into their high spin monatomic state. Scalar waves  encode the information of space and time into a timeless, spaceless quantum shorthand of interference patterns.



Kundalini has the  effect of stimulating an increased flow of ions upping the body’s dipole and increasing the EMF. A cell possesses two characteristics—capacitance and inductance—which are the elements of a tuned circuit like a radio. The cell must be tuned to the desired frequency needed to sustain life.


5% of our nervous system is composed of monatomic elements. Over 5% of the brain tissue by dry matter weight is Rhodium and Iridium. During heightened activation the body can transmute certain palladium group elements such as Iridium and Rhodium into their high spin state by adding energy in the form of photons to the atoms.



It is through this high spin atomic nervous system that we achieve cosmic consciousness, Buddha mind and all ESP and spiritual phenomena


A famous experiment was done by Casimir which proved the energy could be tapped, when two non magnetic plates were placed close together they started to attract and the attraction got exponentially stronger the closer the plates were from each other.  It was then realised that ZPE was causing this effect, the Casimir Effect. The Casimir force is the ultimate cause of friction in the nano-world, in particular in some micro electromechanical systems , like  tiny mechanical devices which triggers a car airbag to inflate .




SonoLuminescence is another display of ZPE in action.  In this action high intensity ultrasound (>20 Kh )cavitation is used on a bath of water with Argon added.   The water glows a bright blue (blue shifted) which is found to be the ZPE spectrum, then bubbles violently.  ZPE gathers on the 100 micron bubble surfaces and when the bubbles implode, massive energy is released creating  temperatures of 5500 degrees C greater than the surface of the sun, and pressures greater than 2000 bars, for less than 1 millionth of a second .. You can see this in the Hollywood thriller Chain Reaction starring Morgan Freeman.



There are antigravity toys on the market which use electromagnet ZPE effects . One of these is a spinning top, which when spun levitates in thin air.


The potentials are the cause, the fields are the effects. In simple terms, pure magnetism and sound are the potentials. Electricity is the field.
Magnetism and sound do not “travel” as such, for they are inherently enfolded in space and are everywhere. It is the disturbance that travels. On the other hand, electrical charge, hence electricity, does travel, because it needs a physical medium.  It is obvious that Physics books do NOT understand  transverse magnetism , longitudinal sound or gravity.




The human ear only collects sound waves. It then translates these sound waves into electrical impulses and sends them to the brain. The brain translates these impulses into actual sounds. If you can directly send the electrical signal (which describes the voice) straight to the subject's brain. Then the subject will hear the sound without actually hearing it through the ears. The ears are completely bypassed in this hearing process. Deaf people can talk on the phone by putting electrodes into their ears . Blind people canm woman see patterns of light by putting electrodes in the back of the brain.



Scalar waves are not blocked by Faraday cages or other kind of shieldings, they are emitted by living systems, and they appear to be intimately involved in, scalar electromagnetics is a unified field theory of electromagnetics and gravitation, since it recaptures the scalar wave portion of electromagnetics .

HAARP --





The brain receives and sends out scalar waves.  Human brain waves contain hidden order. Extreme low frequency bands (ELF) of human brainwaves clearly show that hidden deterministic substructures of hidden electromagnetic order exist concealed inside human brainwaves.  We are steadily contaminating and poisoining the entire planetary potential, and each and every year we are dramatically increasing this deadly effect.


Each cell has its own individual bio-quantum potential.  The planet is a living being,  each cell has its own individual bio-quantum potential , each molecule has its own electromagnetic signature.

Our DNA is capable of producing and receiving sound (phonons) and light (photons) The DNA is a kind of a lens which can attract electromagnetic energy into itself.  Every biochemical reaction is preceded by an electromagnetic signal


Cells themselves have the ability to perfectly reprogram their own DNA when the external environment demands it.  Life is fundamentally electromagnetic than biochemical, the DNA blueprint functioning as a biohologram which serves as a guiding matrix for organizing physical form.  DNA can be influenced by acoustic, electromagnetic and scalar waves our DNA can even be “read” or “rewritten” as a textual (and acoustic!) genetic code.



Hence no antioxidant can be as powerful as thought.  Cymatics has demonstrated the power of acoustics ( mantras ). 

THE SRI YANTRA BELOW IS THE FRACTAL GEOMETRIC DESIGN OF THE UNIVERSE OR THE UNIVERSAL MIND




The Hindu king Mantra OM or AUM is the trigger for Quantum tunneling and wormholes. Breaking a coconut with intention, is the trigger for Quantum butterfly effect and soliton waves.



Yes—mind is over matter. 



The ancient Indian Maharishis were masters of Soliton waves and using resonance. Tesla wanted to resonate the natural nodes of this planet. 

Swami Vivekananda told Tesla to prove all this mathematically on paper, as directed by his Guru Ramakrishna Paramahamsa who did NOT speak English. . Dalton understood Vedic Anu and the whizzing Electrons , but only super-genius Tesla could understand Akasha, the space between the electrons.. 

The BRAHMA ASTRA of Ramayana and Mahabharata wars in 4000BC was a destructive scalar howitzer. Tesla experimented a primitive Brahma Astra at Tunguska in Siberia, after his meeting with Vivekananda. Tesla died with the Brahma Astra ( Scalar Interferometer ) knowledge in his head , as he did NOT want to give this destructive Vedic technology to the US military and Vatican, as promised to Vivekananda. It was to help mankind, NOT to destroy or enslave. 

The lesser Astras ( missiles ) were Thorium based Nuclear. Examples: Agneyastra, Garudastra, Narayanastra, Pashupatastra, Vaishnavastra, Varunastra , Vayuvastra etc-- Prince Arjuna and Prince Rama of Ramayana / Mahabharata wars went to Kerala to make weapons ( Thorium, which hold 150 times more power than Uranium  is found in the Monazite sands of Kerala --No 1 spot of the planet )  


The ancient vedic Maharshis did complex equations inside their heads. They did spherical Trigonometry for Astrology and amazing Sri Yantra ( which contains the Theory of Everything )  geometrical gymnastics inside their heads. 

If you want to know the speed of Vedic Mathematics punch in "Shakuntala Devi" or "Srinivasa Ramanujam"  in Google search. These two bothered to impress the white man by travelling abroad on invitation . Others never cared, as patenting knowlege in a rabid manner like Edison is NOT part of Hindu Dharma. Edison held more patents for Phonograph than the total number of parts it contained, by bribing the Patents house. Out of this 6 are for the wooden cabinet !!




Opposing forces Tamas and Rajas are connected through consciousness ( yin-yang ).  The middle prong of Shiva’s trident is Sattwa. It is about quantum possibility vortex vibrations, between two poles, we call the cosmic dance of Shiva from either side of the Quantum screen... Together they express the great void at absolute peace with itself. To activate the third eye of Shiva, or to perceive higher dimensions, the pineal gland ( soul ) and the pituitary glands ( body ) must vibrate in resonance to create a field. This is represented by Samudra manthan in Hindu mythology, where mount meru is used to churn the oceans for Amrit or Ambrosia in a to and fro movement , representing vibrations.. The amrit of the ambrosia or Soma is the holy grail.  This is what the Templar knights got after excavating King Solomon's temple. Soma is a divine LSD-- rather a million times more powerful DMT. A 12 strand Maharishi with NIL junk DNA can produce it naturally, by resonating his pineal gland with his DNA, and achieve telepathy and psychic teleportation. The psychedelic journeys are accessed and experienced within the realms of the pineal gland. The pineal gland is the Shiva lingam. Serotonin has the same chemical structure as this hallucinogenic substance Soma. Serotonin is transformed into melatonin only in the pineal gland. Decline in melatonin is the trigger for the aging process, for Melatonin is the super-oxidant of nature. The hormone Melatonin, induces sleep, while Serotonin, keeps you happy and in a balanced mental state of mind. PROZAC raises serotonin. The pineal gland produces Pinoline, ( 6-methoxy-tetra-dydro-beta carboline, or 6-MeO-THBC ) . Pinoline also resonates with the very pulse of life 7.83 Hertz, the pulse the DNA uses to replicate, and which has been measured to be emitted from the brains and hands of all successful healers, regardless of belief or faith. OM king mantra is 7.843 hertz. Resonance can vibrate the pineal gland, to release Nuerotransmitter seratonin, melatonin, DMT, etc.  If you have a strong enough sense of consciousness you will taste a huge pituitary release in the back of your mouth and sinuses and throat, it is referred to as ambrosia ( amrit -- mental orgasm discharge ) . This is a result of DMT production . DMT is the spirit molecule that bends space-time. Pineal DMT is the chemical messenger which links body and spirit. Dimethyltryptamine, a psychedelic tryptamine Pinoline enables the threshold levels of DMT to become active in the brain, but it requires an instant bungee jump induced adrenaline burst.  DMT with Pinoline increases brain activation multi fold. You cant observe the quantum world without your Pineal gland -- the other 5 senses have too narrow bandwidths. Quantum physics has showed the ancient Indian Yogis were NOT mere dreamers of cosmic consciousness, where our bodies, our brain and its mind, as inextricably joined with other matter and the mega dipole of universe . There is indeed a connection between consciousness and tangled state quantum phenomena Indian Vedic maharishis had the inherent ability to go on either side of the narrow band of five human senses. THEY COULD TRANSCEND THE SENSES AND LIMITATION OF SPACE-TIME. They firmly believed that the invisible below the quantum screen gives rise to the visible. At the time of death Seratonin and Melatonin in the brain breaks down to Dimethyltryptamine or DMT, C12 N2 H16, just after the oxygen stops circulating. This is the moment for the ultimate DMT trip. You see your whole past life as FRACTAL dvine geometry. When you consume Soma, colours , sounds and numbers all show up as fractal geometry. What you have learnt in the past is of no use to you. As you breathe in the oxygen enters your brain and causes an explosion of fractal colours. To the spiritual eastern mind, the story of SAMUDRA MANTHAN produces amazing acts of faith like the Kumbh Mela , which has been going on for 6000 years. Tamas and Rajas are conscious of each other. Amrit reveals the fractal nature of consciousness. Amrit is NOT external, it is produced inside your head.  All you need to know is how to produce it by your own mind. 12 strand DNA which ancient Maharishis had, has now degraded to 2 strand DNA. These 12 strand DNA maharishis with raised Kundalinis , can read akashik records , convert them from fractal geometry, for daily life use. The cobra on Lord Shiva 's shoulders shows raised Kundalini and open third eye. This self realisation (of opening the third eye) , is the ultimate goal of consciousness. The timeless spiritual wisdom of the of the 7000 year old Vedas will roar to life after Dec 21st 2012- the veil of Maya or delusion over the third eye will be ripped asunder—as the first step towards upgrading the 2 strand 97% junk DNA to 12 strand nil junk DNA.. -- Capt Ajit Vadakayil.

BAR KOKHBA IN FIGHT TO THE FINISH OVER A FORESKIN -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL











I had the opportunity to be in the promised land of Israel and visit almost all the towns ( Jerusalem , Haifa, Ashdod, Akko etc ) having worked for Jewish charterers from Tel Aviv for quite some time. 


They were indeed the quintessential Shylocks and Fagins, greedy and selfish to the core -- i shudder while even thinking about them-- about the meanness of human nature. 


I had many young psuedo Jewish East European friends , who came to this land of milk and honey more out of survival instincts and eking out a decent living , than out of religious faith.


For example , if would ask , say,  a Jew from Russia " If Israel were to play a soccer match with Russia , whom will you cheer for ?" 


Pat would come the reply " Russia of course, I don't care for Israel --when i make enough money i will go back to Russia!".


From such frank guys i learnt a lot about Jews and their mangy propaganda machine. 


ONE SUCH STORY WAS ABOUT BAR KOKHBA.


Bar Kokhba's foolish and selfish antics forced a mass exodus of Jews out of Judea in 136AD.  


Ten thousand of them came to my beautiful and amazing, home state of Kerala in India.  







They lived there unmolested by the locals, till after 1900 years the call of Israel ( read as monetary incentives ) formed in 1948 after the 2nd world war , forced these wretched souls to go back to Israel.  


Kerala is the ONLY place in the world , over 2000 years where Jews were never persecuted or even held in contempt, despite their inheret clannishness and greed. .




Sometimes i wonder--why ALL the people ALL over the world ALL the time --was against the Jews-- Considering what Israel is doing to the Palestinians nowadays , you can guess the answer yourself.





These exodus refugees just followed the path of Thomas ( Jesus's disciple ), who came here by ship after the crucification of christ and died here too. After all since the ancient days of Egyptian Pharaohs and Jewish heroes Kings David/ Solomon --the Malabar cinnamon was more expensive than gold. In fact King Solomon's royal seal is etched in the script of  my native mother tongue MALAYALAM. 


In 7000 BC Emperor Vikramaditya , the Indian Aryan ruled from Jerusalem to Cambodia. The Jewish symbol of star of David is a Dravidian symbol, as is etched on our ancient temples. I am a Dravidian myself.


here we go--


Simon Bar Kokhba was reputed to be the last descendant of the David/ Solomon bloodline.


He had this DELUSION OF GRANDEUR that he is the prophesied messiah and NOT Jesus Christ or John the Baptist .  He went around with the rallying FORESKIN cause to achieve this end . 


He tried to take on the might of the Roman emperor Hadrian Caesar Traianus Hadrianus Augustus,( Marcus Aeurelius of Gladiator hollywood movie fame was his son in law , he groomed him )  whose bust I have seen in the Naples Museum.  Hadrian build the Pantien of Rome and the 117 km long great wall in Scotland.







The bone of contention was Circumcision, which Hadrain banned—as physical mutilation of a god given body part.  It was NOT to provoke the Jews at all.  The style of circumcision practised by Palestinian Jews prior to bar Kokhba removed only the 'tip' of the foreskin, not all of it. Bar Kokhba wanted the entire thing out.





Hardrian ( a homosexual )  did NOT like the bizarre practise of the rabbi using his wine rinsed mouth to suck out the blood from the circumcised penis of babies, in a so called sterilisation procedure. 






Considering the paedophilia in churches nowadays , i guess he was not too far away from the mark.


Hadrian loathed Bar Kokhba who was not a holy man like Christ or John the Baptist. He felt Bar Kokhba was on a selfish personal agenda of taking a place for himself in history .  






He did NOT want this circumcision political/ religious hush hush identity .  If you must have such an identity it should be open , and honourable -- not on your hidden family jewels, unlike the military uniform.   


It was about creating a separate hidden identity for Jews --away from Christians. For the true Christians had rejected Bar Kokhba wholesale.


Bar Kokhba was a extremely cruel man who initiated his 5,50000 soldiers by taking away one small finger. The other choice was to uproot a Cedar tree, which was ENVIRONMENTAL RAPE in those days.


Finally Hadrian declared " enough is enough" and massacred all Bar Kokhba's fanatic army , cornered him and beat him to death. 


His entire army was massacred and left to rot in the sun  , making the stench terrible. A lot of survivors were hiding in deep holes under the ground , with their food, water and gold.  He smoked all of them out , with this stench-- as a military tactic. 





And for 17 years he did NOT allow the Jews to bury their dead. Jerusalem the capital made by King David was banned for all Jews.  Judea was renamed as Palestine.


Hadrain , a noble Caesar  never celebrated his victory and held no victory parade  in Rome as was usual after a hard fought war.





When Bar Kokhba was born i guess they threw away the wrong end.


Pythogarus ( 570 BC – 495 BC ),  Socrates ( 469 BC- 399 BC ) and Plato (727 BC to 347 BC ) studied in Kerala, India.  

The disciple of Plato Aristotle did NOT come to India , but he had very clearly written that Jews originated from Kerala in India.  Aristotle wrote that Jews came from KALANI in India.  He has written that Kalani was famous for their sages ( maharishis ).  These are the same sages who built the Egyptian pyramids.

Alexander the great went back from India via Socotra by ship, to get some life saving Aloe Vera which was a spice trade outpost of Calicut King,  like Mecca and Salalah .

This is the reason why King David took a wife from Kerala named Bath Sheba. King Solomon took a wife from Kerala named whom all call Queen Sheba.  


Jesus Christ took a wife from Kerala named Mary Magdalene.  All know that Jesus Christ suddenly sprung up at Jerusalem from nowhere.  He was in Kerala India, learning healing, meditation, science, philosophy etc.

30 years before the birth of Jesus Christ a lot of Jews came running to Kerala to escape from Herod the Great, the vassal King of Judea .    Herod was actually a Jew who followed Jewish customs , but yet screwed the Jews . .  



He was hardcore and had executed his own wife and two sons. Information about Herod the Great can be found in the Bible in Matthew 2:1-22 and Luke 1:5.  Jesus was born during the rule of Herod the great.

THE GREAT ROMANCE AND CURSE OF THE KOHINOOR-- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL








AN ARRANGEMENT OF CONVENIENCE —AJIT VADAKAYIL

King Edward VIII abdicated his British throne to marry Mrs Wallis Simpson, the woman he loved. Many young girls , world over , swooned over the mere thought of such great romance .

The naked truth is murky and dark.

It was more of a sacrifice than a romance. It was an arrangement of convenience .

He did it for his country . He knew he could never produce a heir and carry on the bloodline by marrying a proper fertile woman.



And Edward spoilt his chances by getting Zionist king makers Rothschild hopping' manby declaring, -- "As long as I am here, there will be no war," said Edward, the then Prince of Wales. 

From the moment he uttered these fateful words to Prime Minister Mr. Stanley Baldwin there was no possibility of him becoming King. 

For Israel had to be carved out and financed out of a great war. 
At Osborne Naval Academy, as a 13 year old boy Edward was teased mercilessly by the other cadets for his tiny dong and his effeminate ways.

Having come from British style Training ship Dufferin myself , where for 2 long years , i shared open showers and shitpots with 250 other cadets at a tender young age, I can well imagine. If you are a gay, you will be exposed on day one.

Edward spend 5 years before he became king in a secluded fort Belvedere near Sunningdale , thoughtfully allowed by his father --away from prying eyes and wagging tongues , with his selected friends for company.

When his father King George V passed away Edward being the eldest of 3 surviving children became king. He started a romance with twice divorced Wallis Simpson, who was a hermaphrodite.

A hermaphrodite is a woman with a dong , but no balls. They are sterile and the twin ammunition dump is missing. Edward was attracted to her manly qualities and was almost a slave to her.

Wallis outlived Edward by 13 years. Towards her final days , her maid and Gyneacologist had seen her private parts properly –it was reported to be like crushedand dried up grapes . Their home was bought by Dodi’s son Mohammed Al Fayed who romanced Diana.

Below: King George VI who could NOT utter a sentence without stammering and spitting all over , with Rothschild's man Churchill who remote controlled him.



Edward VIII , abdicated the throne to his brother King George VI ( Ruler of India ) within 362 days . George was a misfit, terribly shy with a stutter. He would cry and was prone to melancholy.





But his wife Elizabeth ( present queen’s Elizabeth II’s mother ) was very shrewd and managed all affairs with an iron will. She got the great Kohinoor diamond stolen from India for her own crown , and was most of the time sozzled on leg bucklin' ZAZA ( this is 30% gin and 70% dubonnet --neat-- with a slice of lime ).

By the way Lord Krishna called Kohinoor diamond Syamantakam, and could be worn only by Gods or women with harmony . 

Kohinoor signed away to queen Victoria in 1849 by 11 year old boy King Duleep Singh while in exile.  As a reward he could play with the royal kids in London.

LITTLE DO THE BRITISH REALISE THAT THEIR GREAT EMPIRE WENT INTO DECLINE AND THE MENTAL ACQUITY OF THEIR PEOPLE ERODED ( MADCOW ) AS A RESULT OF THE CURSE OF THE KOHINOOR.

Such great stones cannot be mined but are found on riverbeds in their natural state. 6100 years ago a slave stole it from Lord Krishna when he was sleeping.

INDIA WAS THE ONLY SOURCE OF DIAMONDS IN THE WORLD TILL ABOUT 150 YEARS BACK.

VIVA LA DIFFERENCE -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL






What makes a male happy may not be the same for a female, whom god has wired in a different mysterious way.

Striyas charitram purushasya bhagyam , Devo na jaanati-- krito manushyaha !

If you want to keep your city bread --nay-- bred wife happy read on.

She wants unconditional love from you, so don’t try to relate to her abilities in the kitchen or in bed. She wants you in her moment of need , not the next hour. Women are not goal oriented, rather they are relationship oriented. ( better have a good relationship with your female boss.) She will talk to you about problems to get close or to unwind. It is not that she wants a solution from you.. She wants you to show understanding, care, and respect, Don’t argue with her feelings. You breach trust when you intimidate her , the relationship is now irreversibly weakened—like milk which has curdled. On returning home from office or from away-- find her first, and listen to what she has to say. Validate her feelings if she is upset. When going out on your own or away ask her if she wants anything. Compliment her cooking—all her dishes cant be horrible. Women love to dress up , put mascara and lipstick and go out for an occasion—create occasions for that. Or buy her a surprise saree. Once her saree and earrings has seen by all at a wedding function, she will refuse to wear it again. ( ellarum kandu puzhuthu poyi! ) Take a picture of her on special occasions to show that you care. Don’t ignore here in public, especially if she is the mod type. And if she has carried the heaviest bag to the car after a shopping spree with a sullen face — be careful.

If you are a woman and reading this piece—then you must know what keeps your husband happy.
Men look for success to make them worthy of female love. Relax and cooperate with the differences instead of trying to change them, especially in bed. Your nagging might be the repetition of unpalatable truths, but man hates nagging, especially after a hard day. Men unwind by forgetting problems.. Not to be wanted by his woman is slow death for a man. When a man is insecure –his auto response is to say “I don’t care”. Don’t read too much into this. It is usual for men to stop communicating and go into a deep sulk , when he is upset. Only women nag when upset-- just to get centred, men don’t do that, nor they can take that. ( Pssst! What is nagging—just the repetition of unpalatable truths! Ok?) - Macho man hates to be pitied. When he screws it up , if you say—“ it was not your fault”, he will love you for the support and acceptance as he is —this is not the time to go into a high pitched, high octave truth finding exercise. Men blow hot and blow cold , swings between loving intimacy and autonomy( not indifference ) . Men want space, give him that. Man can get angry ( actually upset ) if he has no dang idea what to do next—it need not be finger pointing at you. If a woman wants something she must ask him—say for a sari—man will assume that he is giving her enough and more . Give man the freedom to say NO—it does not mean he means NO and will not say YES as a matter of free manly choice. When your husband is upset lie low, till the hurricane passes.

--and by the way – here is one in the eye for women's lib movement . Ever seen an animal or a bird or a mammal ( insects please excuse ) where the female gender is more beautiful, stronger or intelligent than the male gender?

LET ME END WITH 2 JOKES --


A wife was not at home for a whole night The very next morning, she tells her husband that she stayed at her girlfriend's apartment overnight.

The husband calls 10 of her best girlfriends and none of them confirm that.

Friends of men: A husband was not at home for a whole night. The next morning, he tells his wife that he stayed at his friend's apartment overnight.

The wife calls 10 of his best friends and 5 of them confirm that he stayed at their apartments that night and another 5 are claiming that he is still with them.

"As good as this bar is," said the Scotsman, "I still prefer the pubs back home. In Glasgow , there's a wee place called McTavish's.  The landlord goes out of his way for the locals.  When you buy four drinks, he'll buy the fifth drink."

"Well, Angus," said the Englishman, "at my local in London , the Kings Head, the barman will buy you your third drink after you buy the first two."

"Ahhh, dat's nothin'," said the Irishman, "back home in mE favourite pub Micks, the moment you set foot in the place, they'll buy you a drink, then another, all the drinks you like, actually.  Then, when you've had enough drinks, they'll take you upstairs and see dat you gets laid. All on the house!"

The Englishman and Scotsman were suspicious of the claims. The Irishman swore every word was true.

"Did this actually happen to you?"

"Not mEself, personally, no," admitted the Irishman, "but it did happen to mE sister quite a few times." 

Viva la difference!

Women still want to be the first to be rescued from sinking ships. When the President of world women's liberation organisation got a flat car tyre after a conference. she waited nervousy  ( hiding her badge )  till a kind man changed her car tyre.


On the other hand , if a wife wears the pants and shirt of her husband --no problem. But if the husband wears his wife's saree or salwar, god save him from society!


A sexual affair , which does not come under the category of rape, can never be 49:51 as women pretend to.  It is always 50:50.  

Bottom lines:   Nobody will ever win the Battle of the Sexes. There's just too much fraternizing with the fuckin' enemy. - Henry Kissinger




Two of the hottest topics in women's magazines— why men are such filthy pigs AND how to attract a man!


I am sure no sane Indian woman wants " maker of self statues " or " bong express" as the Prime minister of India.  


Mahabharata war was started by a vain Draupadi , who ridiculed Duryodhana , when he slipped and fell into the water pool.  First she ridiculed him because he was circumspect with all highly polished and  reflective floorings looking like water pools.


Ramayana war was started by Sita, who refused to go back with Hanuman, and wanted Rama to fight Ravana and win the war, and then take her back.

We in India love to say that our women are Sati savitris. Take this from a sailor of 4 decades. God has made all women the same. Indian women are afraid of social stigma.  Otherwise they are as bold and daring as the women of the west.

And if you ask any woman , what type of man she wants. She will give bull about sense of humor, character-- blah blah-- all of them want only one type of man in their darkest dreams-- THE original caveman.

When a lady is pregnant, all her friends touch the stomach and saying "congrats".  She expects it.
But, none of them come and touch the man's penis and say "Good job".  --and he does NOT expect it.

Now let me say something that even women will agree - " female bosses in a male-dominated environment will invariably wreck other women's promotion hopes, especially if she is better lookin' than her".

-- any woman dares to disagree?  suggest you don't-- coz-- this has been researched in almost all the western countries. Even women prefer men customs officers at the airport RED channel.

Here is a bad joke to make all women hoppin' mad at me -- ( just for kicks ! i hope my wife does not read it, for she will kick mE ass-- )

A man will help a woman undress here multilayered tedious clothing before sex.   However after sex, she always dresses on their own. 
Moral of the story:  In life, no one helps you , once you're screwed.

Roman Catholics who read this blog MUST listen to their soul and hearts.


I am indeed NOT a religion baiter-- just a frank ship captain and a leader of men for 30 years , who has seen first hand what this planet has to offer-- i  hardly care for the loaded written word or tilted playing fields anymore.  I am just a slave of my own conscience.


When i visited the Vatican and St Peters cathedral on Easter day-- i could feel the bad vibes. Was it a holy place? Was it a haven of evil?


Did the Nazi Holocaust carry on from where the Inquisition left off?.


Have not the Vatican storm troopers killed by the most brutal and bizzare ways more than 50 million human beings on this planet?  and what was the fault of these poor victims ?  that they just did not want a middle man pope between themselves and their god --or their religion was unapproved?


The pope even wanted to censor and abridge scientific texts. What type of holy father is he?  How did poor Galileo accused of heresy become blind? What is all this ecclesiastical dispensation?


What about the blood money, confiscated properties of the condemned,  and laundering operations of the Vatican? Is there a link between Swiss banks and Vatican? What about the infamous BCCI scandal? --imagine buddhist clergy who live by begging laundering their money.





Why is nobody taking a stand against this CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY -- paedophile priests getting immunity!



It is estimated that 30 million small innocent children , out of 1200 million Catholics have been abused and sodomised by catholic priests.  how many of these priests are in jail?  what is the need for condoms inside monastries? 



 It is estimated that 42% or 36000 of all Catholic nuns have been sexually molested by a survey recently. What drove the nuns to fund this survey?  did anybody care?






The clergy bluntly states " we have compensated the victims!" --what type of a bullshit statement is this?




Why are these men in medevial dresses and curved staffs allowed to prey upon the insecurities and trust of the defenceless young?  



Would you like your own child or sister to be sodomised or abused  by a Latin speakin' pervert in fancy church robes?




Have not several repentant priests in the Inquisition days confessed just prior dying, that Inquisition fear was put into beautiful girls from noble families to have sex.





Does Jesus Christ need celibate helpers?





Does god have a hotline with the pope?



Is church becoming the last refuge of the sexually perverted , the pathologically and diabolically sick ? Why do they get alarmed when another religion spreads faster due to its inherent goodness, without the religion being rammed down the throats and mental prostitution ?



It is common knowledge among IT experts that maximum gay, anal and bestial INTERNET surfing percentage by population, is from inside the Vatican. ( It is NOT muslim Pakistan ,as the west love to repeat )



Are these happy and moral denizens of this planet? (OSHO had said that sexual repression is the biggest cause of evil deeds and diseases on this planet. Can you imagine a sexually repressed animal in a free jungle? God never meant it this way!!)




Why is the pope getting political immunity, as a head of state? Is it not ripe time for this privelage to be terminated?


Just before the Communism died--how did a communist pope take charge?  How many of you know that Karl Marx, Lenin and Stalin were JEWS?




Will the next pope be a slit eyed Chinese man? -- before Chinese  communism drives itself into the ground?





Is Vatican a parasitic organisation, with a sickness inherent in the system ?


What spiritual leadership does it offer?  is there not a culture of self deception?



How did 100 odd Chinese who got killed in the Tiannaman square get canonised? --- are they saints by any stretch of imagination?


How many Indians will vouch for the fact that a mere locket of canonised Mother Teresa cured a Bengali woman of terminal cancer tumor?. Here own doctor had vociferously maintained that all she had was a benign tumor,  which he cured giving her prescribed medicines. Why does the Pope require false poster girls?





How did the LAST CRUSADER  (260 of the line ) Pope Pius XII Pacelli , who killed more men than Hitler during the 2nd world war , using Croat super-sadist Ante Pavelic get canonised?--and that too 65 years after his death?



 


Does not Roman Catholic Father Petar Brzica hold the world record for slitting 1360 Serbian Orthodox Christian throats in one single night , earning a gold watch as a reward. When the British army reported this to Vatican , was it not conveniently ignored by Pope Pius XII.







Did not mother saint Theresa , who hardly got her gnarled hands dirty ( except during photo shoots ) get the Nobel prize for opening up more than 700 convents worldwide ? Did she ever differentiate between good money and bad money received as donations ? Did she NOT diabolically showcase human suffering in India , as an open sore, and wrangle more than 1 billion dollars in donations, to further Vatican's cause?



and this is something this world must know--


-- some exhumed truth-


Pope Pius XII ( the same pope who killed more people than Hitler during the Serb Orthodox Christian inquisition ) was directly responsible for the American war in Vietnam.  He used drug trade money power to put a Vatican puppet and staunch Roman Catholic president Ngo Dinh Diem, as president of Vietnam in 1955. His brief was to persecute the Buddhists and convert them to Christianity.  Diem was instructed to give death penalty to communists in 1956 . In the war America supported the Catholic south . The result was 50000 American soldier casualities and 2 million Vietnamese exterminated--and the greatest rape of this planet by Agent Orange-- ordered by JFK.




Pope Pius XII along with John Foster Dulles ( secretary of state for President Eisenhower ) -- both committed anti-communists , were responsible for the start of the COLD WAR and so much human misery..





Thought:  man will never do evil so gleefully , unless he is convinced that god ( or his middle man with a hot line ) wanted him to do it that way.  Power is the biggest intoxicant not LSD .



Recently forty women who have had secret affairs with priests ask Pope Benedict to the lift sex ban on the Roman Catholic clergy.



Their letter describes the vow as a "tattered shroud" and explains how they must "live daily with the doubts, fears and insecurities of our men" because their relationships are clandestine. Indeed, they point out that many of Jesus’s disciples were married. They suggested that priests were allowed to live normal lives then the number of sex abuse scandals might fall.  



But current Pope Benedict responded by saying he was in favour of "the principle of holy celibacy".-- This is despite evidence that many past Popes had secret wives and children .

 (Some like Pope Pius XII of WW2 was quite blatant about having his beautiful Bavarian "housekeeper" Sister Mary Pascualina Lehnert live with him for 41 years.)




How many of you know that Roman Italian Inquisition started only in 1545, with the Indians in Goa, when Francis Xavier impressed on Pope Paul III, the urgent need to punish the filthy pestilent Indians, worshiping evil back stones and following false doctrines . 20000 were tortured and killedin Goa India,  before the British stopped the Portuguese saying Enough is Enough. The same Inquisition blinded Galileo in 1633.. All under investigation had to wear a huge red X symbol on their dress .




It was Pope Paul III who restarted slavery in Rome , by repealing a timeless law that slaves could claim their freedom at the Emperor's statue at Capitol hill . After this all Muslims, man and woman , became slaves, automatically. This sick man made his grandsons cardinals even before the age of 14.

Below is Xavier, heeding the voice of GOD, to punish all the non-believers.

LOVE -- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL



LOVE IS UNSTABLE.  HENCE SOCIETY CAUSED MARRIAGE TO COME INTO EXISTENCE. 

LOVE IS A FRESH FLOWER-- MARRIAGE IS PLASTIC.   

YOU CAN MARRY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD-- AFTER 2 MONTHS SHE WONT EXCITE YOU ANY MORE PHYSICALLY.  HENCE NEVER MARRY FOR BEAUTY.

MARRIAGE IS THE DEATH OF LOVE.  MARRIAGE IS A GREAT EFFORT BETWEEN TWO PERSONS TO CREATE A CONTINUING SYMPHONY.  WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS THE STRINGS ARE STILL ATTACHED.

LOVE IS THE GREATEST GIFT OF GOD.  IT IS THE ONLY EXPERIENCE WHICH TRANSCENDS TIME.   WHEN A GIRL PEEPS FROM BEHIND THE CURTAINS TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HER BELOVED, SHE WILL NOT KNOW HOW TIME FLIES.

LOVE TRANSCENDS AGE , RACE , CREED AND RELIGION.   MOST OF THE TIME WHEN YOU SAY YOU ARE IN LOVE, IT IS JUST AN ARRANGEMENT OF CONVENIENCE.

A CANCER PATIENT ON A TWO WAY STREET OF LOVE CAN CURE HIMSELF-- SUCH IS THE POWER OF MIND OVER MATTER.

RELATIONSHIP IS A STRUCTURE, LOVE IS UNSTRUCTURED.

TRUE LOVERS HAVE GIVEN EACH OTHER A FEW MOMENTS OF ETERNITY.. THEY WILL REMEMBER THESE MOMENTS, BE GRATEFUL TO EACH OTHER AND DEPART AS FRIENDS.

LOVE CANNOT BE MANAGED , IT JUST HAPPENS.   

LOVE IS ABOUT TWO HEARTS BEATING AS ONE IN RESONANCE.  IT MAKES THE LOVERS ACT SILLY.  

LOVE MAKES YOU LOSE SLEEP-- FOR REALITY IS NOW FAR BETTER THAN YOUR WET DREAMS.

LOVE’S WAYS ARE BEYOND YOU. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO KNOW WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE TO START OR STOP IT.  IF YOU WANT TO START IT AND END IT ON YOUR TIMETABLE, THEN IT WAS NOT LOVE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

LOVE IS AN UNCONDITIONAL GIFT, NOT A BARGAIN.  IT BLOSSOMS ONLY IF YOU DROP YOUR EGO.

LOVE IS THE ONLY NOURISHMENT FOR THE SOUL. 

LOVE IS THE ONLY BEAUTIFYING PHENOMENON IN EXISTENCE. YOUR BODY RADIATES IT.,  IT IS NOT PART OF THE BODY— IT COMES FROM DEEPER  SOURCES.

A WOMAN BECOMES BEAUTIFUL JUST BECAUSE YOU LOVE HER.  THE HEART SEES WHAT IS INVISIBLE TO THE EYE.  IT IS ABOUT SEEING A IMPERFECT PERSON PERFECTLY.

IF LOVE BRINGS MISERY, IT CANNOT BE LOVE.  SOMETHING ELSE IS MASQUERADING AS LOVE. ANALYSE IT AND BE READY TO DROP IT.

THE PAIN OF LOVE LASTS A LIFETIME.   LOVE IS FELT ONLY BY THE HEART.


WISDOM ON LOVE AND LIFE (LIKE  POETRY) IS NOT THERE IN THE WORDS,  IT ONLY HOVERS AROUND IT.  YOU MUST BE UNFOCUSSED WHEN YOU READ IT TO CATCH HOLD OF IT. 

 

 




Note: "All you need is love" is full of meaning.  A cancer patient can cure himself if he falls in love on two way lane.  The heart generates the largest field in the body, thousand of times stronger than its nearest competitor, the brain.  This is why when you fall in love at first sight you will yawn -- a great release of energy, which can be felt by the subject.

WATER VALLEY AND WALKING ON WATER-- CAPT AJIT VADAKAYIL









If you make the sound "Om" in front of a drop of liquid, it will transform itself into a Sri Yantra which is very specific visual form which is symmetrical and also holographic, in that every bit of it contains all of it.

Molecules of water are affected by our thoughts, words, and feelings. The average electron density around the oxygen atom in a water molecule is about 10 times that around the hydrogen atoms. This non uniform distribution of positive and negative charges or strong DIPOLE present in water leads to the substance’s unusual behavior.

A single molecule of water looks like a letter V at an angle of 105 deg , with one oxygen atom at the bottom point and two hydrogen atoms at the top. These atoms share some of their negatively charged electrons, forming a strong connection called a covalent bond. THIS DIPOLE CAUSES IMMENSE SCALAR ENERGY TO USHER IN AND OUT OF ZERO POINT FIELD.





All water crystals have 6 branches--but NO two are alike. If you reduce the surface tension of water from 75 dynes / cm 2 to 65 then the angle changes from 105 to 120. This water is good for the human body.








All Hindu temples are located near a water body. The properties of Ganges water and Zam Zam water from Mecca is well known.

Even a small amount of water has enough cluster structures available to absorb whole libraries of information ( theertham in a rishi’s copper lota ).

I would not be surprised if in the future Silicon valley is renamed as Water valley. For water can store information about substances that were once in it but that have physically disappeared. Latest generation computer robotic research is investigating water's capacity to order and transmit information, as an improvement to silicon. Water should be the source of energy in the future via energy carrier hydrogen.



Water is the very source of all life . The quality of our life depends on it. 97% of water on this planet is salt water. Out of the balance 3% fresh water, 2/3 is ice.

Water is colourless, odourless and tasteless at room temperature.

Water covers 70 percent of Earth’s surface, makes up 65% of the human body. Brain is 83% water, blood-92%, kidneys - 82%, liver-69% , muscles-75%, bones-28%.


50 to 90% weight of living organisms is water.

Our brain stores information in the holographic form. Every cell in our body carries all information to produce a copy.


Without water, the blood wont move. A human being will die within 3 days of being deprived of water, as cells, blood and tissues are deprived of the water content. Water is the lubricant of all moving parts in the body. All cells are water cooled.


In homeopathy the information copied to the water is being used to cancel out the information of the symptoms from the disease -- a wave cancellation effect. Water is the master listener in the universe -- and you are mostly water. The gravity of the moon affects the tides just like the periods of a woman.

Water has an unusually large heat capacity, requiring a lot of energy to increase its temperature. This characteristic prevents Earth from getting too hot or too cold, and it slows the temperature changes in oceans, biological cells, and tissues, making conditions possible for life. Water is one of the best known solvents .

Liquid water absorbs radiation of all wavelengths, except a narrow window in the visible (photochemical) waveband. This window is critical for photolysis and directly or indirectly influences the development of all life on Earth.

Water’s high thermal conductivity speeds up heat redistribution in living tissues, which helps protect the body from uneven heating and cooling, whether such changes are caused by metabolic processes or external mechanisms.


Though water freezes at zero deg C , however if it is kept inside the capillaries which have the dimensions less than a hair thickness, it will remain fluid even at a very low temperature below zero. In areas of the earth where water freezes at night and thaws again in the morning, we find the toughest rocks splitting and being broken down. Ice melts when slight pressure is applied, but under high pressure, liquid freezes. If you open a bottle of pressurized soda water, it will freeze instantly. Water is the only substance that has its highest density as a liquid.

Water also has a high heat of vaporization, so a lot of energy from the Sun is needed to turn liquid water into vapor. It takes four times as much energy to heat a given mass of water by 1°C as it does to heat the same mass of dry air. Perspiration is the most effective way to cool the human body. Water bodies in the tropics don't get evaporated so quickly.

As temperature increases, a substance’s density generally decreases. But pure water is an exception to this rule—it is the only known substance that has its highest density as a liquid. It is the only natural substance found in all three states -- solid, liquid and gas -- within the range of natural Earth temperatures.

It has very high surface tension (helping it move through roots and capillaries -- vital to maintaining life on Earth) and is virtually incompressible. Because of the internal tension of water it can drag itself upwards through tall trees without breaking off in its upwards flow. This upwards flow is caused by the water flowing out of the leaves into the air, pulling more water up as it does so . The high surface tension of water - its tendency to fight being pulled apart - explains why it forms droplets and why it climbs up the sides of a straw.

A well-known anomaly of water is that its density is highest at four degrees Celsius above the freezing point. Thus, ice floats on water, whereas the solid state of other compounds would sink in their liquids. This permits life to survive safely under the ice during freezing weather. Ice would sink to the bottom of the sea otherwise , away from the melting warmth of the sunshine. Unlike other liquids, water expands in freezing.Completely pure water is a poor conductor of electricity

Water is the universal medium for all biological activity; it dissolves, dilutes, transports, and reacts with every chemical essential for life. Cell-associated water (vicinal water) has different properties than ordinary water. It is less dense, requires more energy to heat, has greater viscosity, and different phase change temperatures.

The most mysterious and controversial property of water, however, is its ability to hold and store memory. This property underlies the healing capability of homeopathy. A homeopathic solution usually in water is produced via a series of dilutions of a substance, often until effectively no atoms of the original material remain. Only an imprint or memory remains for the cure, and the greater the dilution, the greater the effectiveness. The experiments showed that the immune system can be triggered using hundred times dilutions of an aqueous solution of an antibody.. If water has a memory then the water we drink is transferring its memory into our "water body," just like a homeopathic solution does.

Human vibrational energy, thoughts, words, ideas and music, affect the molecular structure of water, The body is very much like a sponge and is composed of trillions of chambers called cells that hold liquid.  In this sense water not only has the ability to visually reflect the environment but it also molecularly reflects the environment. Miracle waters have been discovered throughout the world and have been responsible for thousands of unexplainable healings.

Water registers precise molecular information about the world around it, and that is extremely sensitive to these frequencies coming into it.Water remembers, or stores this information, and that it can transport this into new environments when it travels through various water cycles. The oceans have a water cycle where vast internal rivers,that we call ocean currents, flow through all the salt waters of our world, carrying warm and cold waters to affect various countries' weather patterns, flora and fauna.

These enormously powerful currents dive down kilometers deep into the watery darkness when they cool near the ice caps and then rise again thousands of miles away in warm waters, spreading food worldwide for what used to be a stupendously rich marine life. Water can wipe out previous molecular energy information and start afresh, starting anew in the present moment to receive the latest upgrade, so to speak. Water appears to have a type of thinking capacity within itself as a freely moving liquid without a nervous system needing to be formed. Water responds to subtle events even far out in the cosmos and that it is a far more sensitive medium for reception .


It is also known that water receives cosmic radiation as extreme low frequencies everywhere, even deep down five kilometres below the sea, creating resonances or vibrations that are healing and healthy for nature since the world began. the moon, the sun and even the stars communicate with water, and our earth itself is retuning its resonances constantly to this influx. Water molecules group together in vast numbers of unusually long 'cluster structures', and these can vibrate like a musical instrument receiving and giving off a wide variety of differing frequencies.

Water has high dielectric constant or relative permitivity of 81. This means the force of attraction between ions is 81 times lesser in water than in vacuum, and this allows them to separate. High dielectric constant is equivalent of high insulating properties, to lower the attraction between oppositely charged ions, once they are solvated.. Thus, water is a powerful solvent and a medium for biochemical reactions. It is the universal solvent, being one of the best solvents we have, with 84 out of the known 103 elements on this planet being dissolved by it.

If you get pure coherent water flowing fast enough it can cut metal. Water jets are able to cut because the spray is channeled through a very narrow jeweled nozzle at a very high pressure to keep the spray coherent. Unlike metal cutters, a water jet never gets dull and it cannot overheat.. The latest machines can cut to within less than a half a mm, and have jet speeds around Mach 3. 





The nozzle is a diamond hole. A water jet can cut a "sandwich" of different materials up to four inches thick. This odorless, dust-free and relatively heat-free process can also cut something as thin as half a mm. The tiny jet stream permits the first cut to also be the final finished surface. This single cutting process saves material costs and machining costs.. The water pressure is typically around 4000 bars.

A water jet can strip paint at a distance of 15 metres of if you alter the chemistry of plain water by adding a soluble polymeric chemical that acts like a series of molecular spinal columns or concrete reinforcement bars that tie the individual water molecules together in a more structured way to form a coherent jet.



Abrasive water jets , using diamond powder abrasive, cut into the hard hull of the submarine Kursk to recover the bodies of the Russian crew . This abrasive jet has an internal ruby orifice to produce a thin dia jet of water capable of cutting materials over half a metre thickness of steel while producing a taper of less than 1 degree with Ultra High Pressure Water of 6000 bars produced by a Water jet Intensifier Pump

Nobel prize winner Alex Carrel (who kept a chicken heart tissue alive for 37 years) had said that the secret of life is to feed and nourish the cells and let the flush the waste and toxins.  To achieve toxin release efficiently with minimum quantity of water you must lower the surface tension of water from 73 dynes to 45 dynes. You can drink a large quantity of high tension water, -- it is NO use. 

If you drink water that’s harmonious to the human body, water will pass through the body within ten to 15 minutes. The (harmonious) water will carry out toxins. Ordinary water has a surface tension of 73 dynes per centimeter, our body cells require 45 for fast permeation and hydration. If the ST is too high, the cell drowns in its own waste products as there will be less flushing action. Scalar energy from the DNA of healers reduce the surface tension of water, and make the pH of the water more alkaline.

The oxygen atom grabs more of the shared electrons, which makes it slightly negative, leaving the hydrogen ends slightly positive. This small shift in charge is what attracts water molecules to each other.

The hydrogen atoms within each water molecule are strongly drawn toward the oxygen atoms in neighboring molecules. In fact, the hydrogen partners are so fickle that a water molecule changes partners ten billion to a hundred billion times a second. Water appears to be H 1.5 O rather than H2O ( hence the fantastic dissolving action ).

No one understands, why liquid water is able to carry so much heat . Water has a large heat capacity; it can take in a lot of heat without its temperature increasing very much. This makes it an especially good coolant for a car radiator, and it's the main reason temperatures are moderate for coastal communities - as the ocean is slow to cool down or warm up.

Water, sanctified by chanting mantras or by bathing an idol is known as theertham.’Living water’ is an organized state of matter and energy, and capable of storing and transmitting information. Water in everything we eat or drink carry with it a subtle informational content that imparts a "memory" into our "water body." The visual images that we encounter, the sounds that we hear, and our thoughts are encoded into the water of our cells to become a part of our unconscious mind.

Molecules of water are affected by our thoughts, words, and feelings. The implications go beyond homeopathy and ’energy medicine" and into the interaction between water and consciousness.


Water has a memory in which it stores information about the surrounding sounds, chemicals and even human emotions. Water retains information, even after the most stringent purification and filtration processes The memory is stored in clusters of H20 molecules that are formed when several molecules join together.

Our thoughts and expectations broadcast energy like a radio station that influence matter on the subatomic quantum level. If you intend that quantum particles should act or behave in a certain way, they will do as you intend. If another man thought they should behave in a completely different way, they did just that as well. In other words, the very particles that make up our physical reality changed and responded according to the specific thoughts of the observing individual’s expectations.

The water molecule is not linear but bent in a special way. As a result, part of the molecule is negatively charged and part positively charged.

The hydrogen ion is positively charged. A water ioniser changes the hydrogen ion into a negative charge. Free radicals are a natural byproduct of cellular function. Free radicals expel an electron, and the extra electron damages neighboring cell nuclei and DNA, setting the stage for improper cell division and replication.

The chemistry of life is water chemistry. Without water's capacity to store and share information as different vibrating frequencies in an extraordinary manner,living cells would not be able to communicate with each other .

We worry about taking a external bath—how about taking a proper internal bath? --for water is the universal medium for all biological activity; it dissolves, dilutes, transports, and reacts with every chemical essential for life. 

The water we drink is 3 billion years old. 

Water can propagate fast moving 5th dimension antigravity soliton waves, maintaining its shape and velocity without dissipating its energy ( example- tsunami ).





Hot water can be frozen faster than cold water-- Spray a fine mist of boiling water in sub zero temperatures and you get instant snow. When water is cooled to < minus 135 deg C it forms a syrup called glassy water.

Water blessed by healers have minor shifts in its molecular structure and decreases hydrogen bonding between the molecules, similar to what happens when water is exposed to magnets.

Water can act as a acid as well as a base.  water is amphiprotic or ampholytic and can act as an acid ( by losing an H+ion ) and as base ( by gaining an H+ ion ).



An oxygen atom has six electrons in its outer (valence) shell, which can hold a total of eight. When an oxygen atom forms a single chemical bond, it shares one of its own electrons with the nucleus of another atom and receives in return a share of an electron from that atom. When bonded to two hydrogen atoms, the outer electron shell of the oxygen atom is filled.




You can use a water drop like in the picture as a spherical lens –and can project all bacteria inside using a laser beam as a monstrously large shadows show on a screen behind.

Sonoluminescence -- or spectacular conversion of sound to light , happens when water is bombarded by intense light waves creating air bubbles which rapidly contract and implode with a flash of light. There is a Hollywood Morgan Freeman movie on this --CHAIN REACTION. In the movie a spherical glass cage is resonated by harmonious sound waves of 20 KHz. Then a very tiny air bubble is blown into the centre, where it implodes at temperatures of 30000 deg C.  The light comes from the zero point field.



Want to walk on water like Jesus Christ?  Increase the shear of water by using a transparent medium. and you can have everybody amazed and praying to you . First try it in your kitchen soup. Add 2 parts of corn starch to 1 part of water. Your fingers still will detect it like water. But give an abrupt punch--it will bounce you hand back like a solid trampoline--or rather a viscoelastic membrane.




WATER IS THE ONLY DRINK OF A WISE MAN!
